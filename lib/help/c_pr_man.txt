#####R=== Manwe's Priests ===

#####GDescription
As the forces of darkness arose, *****g_manwe.txt*0[Manwe], lord of air, realised that urgent
action was needed to save Arda from the incoming darkness. So he started 
gathering followers from the ranks of men and elves and he instructed them to 
do battle against the forces of Udun. 

His priests must be quick and strike before the situation becomes
critical, always keeping a direct line of prayer with their patron deity.

Manwe doesn't tolerate laziness, but He also does not appreciate mindless 
killing; only a few measure up to his standards, but those are granted access 
to a whole series of divine powers which will help them in their enduring 
efforts.
