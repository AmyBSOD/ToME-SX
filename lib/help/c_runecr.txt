#####R=== Runecrafters ===

#####GDescription
Instead of using spellbooks like the other spellcasters they instead 
use mystic runes. To cast a spell they select a primary rune of the 
elements (fire, cold, etc.) and they also choose a set of secondary runes,
which shape the effect of the first one. The secondary runes include 
Self, Arrow, Ray, ... and Armageddon. After that they chose the amount 
of mana to use and the spell is cast! But the more secondary runes they
chose the more mana is used to cast the spell. They also are bad 
fighters, but if they concentrate all their mana in one spell 
(especially with a mage staff of mana) they could kill nearly anything.

*A Runecrafter cannot learn the Geomancy skill, but it is shown in his skill 
screen because the elemental schools are sub-skills of it.

#####GRune Magic
Runecrafters combine runes using the 'm' command.  They first select a 
rune that controls magic type, then apply one or more runes to fine-tune
effects, (pressing ESC when done), and then input the amount of mana 
they wish to expend on the spell.

Runecrafters can cast the spells from their runes in several ways:
1. On-the-fly by combining runes when they need them.
2. Memorise rune combinations for quick use when needed (and they don't
   need to be able to see then!), and then later cast from memory.
3. Carving them into a Runestone, then using the Runestone later (takes
   less mana, but they have to be able to see).

[[[[[BSpell Types:]

     Knowledge:  Identify all objects in affected grids, Self-knowledge 
          if Self rune is used.

          is used.
     Fire, Cold, Lightning, Acid:  Casts magics of that element.
     Elements:  Irresistible damage.
     Mind:  A mind blast that badly effects intelligent monsters.  
          Temporary ESP if Self rune is used.
     Gravity:  A gravity spell that both does damage and whisks affected 
          creatures around.

[[[[[BSpell Effects] (all are listed):
     Self:  Effects the caster.  This rune can be used with any other;
          if used alone, only the caster's grid is affected.
