#####R=== Thaumaturgists ===

#####GDescription
A Thaumaturgist is a Mage that prefers chaos to order. As such, they tend to 
learn random spells, and since attacking something creates more chaos than 
anything else, every spell they learn is an attack spell. They have no need 
for spell-books, as they harness the spells from within themselves. However, 
they also have no ability to improve the power of a particular spell - once 
learnt it will remain at the same strength for ever. Likewise, they also have
no ability to control what they learn, and some of their spells will cause 
them damage (like darkness spells blinding them if they do not resist 
darkness).

#####GThaumaturgy
Thaumaturgists can wreak an amazing amount of destruction, and they don't 
even need spellbooks to do it. As they gain skill they memorise new,
randomly generated attack spells. Note that they possess no guaranteed
utility or alteration magics, and can never alter themselves.
[[[[[BThaumaturgists just kill.]

They use their magics through the 'm' key. They then select a general 
group of spells, followed by a specific spell. Thaumaturgists can learn 
more about a specific spell by browsing it; this is very useful for 
choosing the perfect spell for the occasion.

Thaumaturgy spells can take the form of a bolt, a beam, a ball (either
centred on the caster or targetable), an area (multiple balls in the
vicinity of the caster), or a spell that affects all monsters in line of sight.
