#####GVaire's Magic
Worshipping Vaire gives the adventurer access to a set of special
spells that come directly from the hands of Vaire. These spells use your piety
to cast rather than your spellpoints, and the level of spells that Vaire will 
permit you to use is determined by your Prayer skill - how skillful you are
in asking for her help without offending her!

There is a special book called the "Tome of History" which 
contains instructions for the procedure for each of the prayers Vaire will
grant. There are five prayers all told, which are:
1. [[[[[BTick Tock] (Level 1)
   Shoots a bolt of time from your fingertips.
   Sometimes it can blast through its first target.
2. [[[[[BSpider Form] (Level 15)
   Temporarily turns you into a spider.
3. [[[[[BTimeline] (Level 20)
   Creates a time wall that affects monsters who walk into it.
4. [[[[[BDecontaminate] (Level 30)
   Reduces your contamination.
5. [[[[[BTime Tempest] (Level 40)
   Starts a time-based thunderstorm.
   Each turn it hits a random monster in sight with time damage.
   
Each of these spells can be increased in level both by improving your Prayer
skill, and by improving your Spell-power skill.

In addition to her specific magic, Vaire will also assist with your ability to
use some magic from the "standard" schools, in relation to how skilled you 
are at Prayer. These schools are as follows:
    *****m_tempo.txt*0[Temporal School] at 2/3 the Prayer skill level.
    *****m_celest.txt*0[Celestial School] at 1/3 the Prayer skill level.
    *****m_demono.txt*0[Demonology School] at 1/3 the Prayer skill level.

The spells from these schools are all cast using your normal spellpoints.
