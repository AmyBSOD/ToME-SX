#####R=== Gnomes ===

#####GDescription
Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than halflings. Like the hobbits,
they live in the earth in burrow-like homes. Gnomes make excellent magi,
and have very good saving throws. They are good at searching, disarming,
perception, and stealth. They have lower strength than humans and they are
not very good at fighting with hand weapons, but have developed a fondness
for the crossbow. Gnomes have fair infra-vision, so they can detect
warm-blooded creatures at a distance. Gnomes are intrinsically protected
against paralysis and some slowing effects. At higher levels, gnomes learn
to teleport at will.
