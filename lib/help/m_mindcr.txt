#####R === ToME Magic - Mindcraft ===
Mindcrafting uses the power of the mind to cast its spells. Therefore neither
books nor light are necessary, and as the mindcrafter's skill increases, so do
the powers of his mind.

The powers are accessed using the 'm' key and then selecting 'Use Mindcraft';
they are cast with spell points, like normal spells, which can be increased
as usual through the *****skills.txt*21[Magic] skill.
