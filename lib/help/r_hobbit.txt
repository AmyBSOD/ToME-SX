#####R=== Hobbits ===

#####GDescription
Hobbits, or halflings, are very good at ranged combat (especially with slings),
throwing, and have good saving throws. They also are very good at searching,
disarming, perception and stealth; so they make excellent rogues, but prefer
to be called burglars.  They are much weaker than humans, and not good at melee
fighting.  Halflings have fair infra-vision, so they can detect warm creatures
at a distance. Hobbits have their dexterity sustained and in time they learn to
cook a delicious meal from available ingredients.  Their sturdy constitutions
also allow them to resist the insidious poison of the ring-wraiths.
