#####R === ToME Magic - Conveyance School ===

The conveyance school of magic contains spells where the forces of space are
manipulated by the spell. There are rumours of a "Tome of of Translocation"
which contains all the conveyance school spells within its bindings.

Worshipping the God Manwe Sulimo also gives the ability to cast spells from
the conveyance school at a level of 1/2 of your prayer level. E.g. if the
skill "Spirituality: Prayer" is at level 10, you can cast up to level 5
conveyance school spells.
