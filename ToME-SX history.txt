Version history for ToME-SX by AmyBSOD, given in reverse chronological order *bundlebundlebundle* <3

August 2024

- Added the theftproof flag to some boss monsters.
- If the player is caught trying to steal from a monster, that particular monster can no longer be stolen from.
- Quests can generally no longer be failed now; "failure" conditions hit the player with bad effects instead, but the quests can be attempted again.
- The new ultimate artifacts can now be created.
- Fates can now happen at any experience level (they used to only happen at XL11 and above), and the "never die by the hand of a mortal" fate is back, but balanced.

- Capped dark sword antimagic bonuses at an enchantment value of -10.
- Recalling to the dungeon now always gives a level feeling, even if it's less than 100 turns since you were in the dungeon.

- If genocide doesn't work due to the player being on a no-genocide level, there is a message indicating it now.

- Deathmolds can now walk onto adjacent shops or other town features, as well as all types of stair including shafts and "paths".
- Targetted teleportation now also accepts the * key to give the old targetting cursor with the ability to scroll the screen. No longer is the power limited by what's currently visible on the screen.
