#####R=== Warriors ===

#####GDescription
A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of his problems
by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back on the help 
of a magical device or a bow. 

A Warrior learns no magic, and can even suppress it like an Unbeliever through 
the Antimagic skill.
