#####GNienna's Magic
Worshipping Nienna gives the adventurer access to a set of special
spells that come directly from the hands of Nienna. These spells use your piety
to cast rather than your spellpoints, and the level of spells that Nienna will 
permit you to use is determined by your Prayer skill - how skillful you are
in asking for her help without offending her!

There is a special book called the "Tome of Sorrow" which 
contains instructions for the procedure for each of the prayers Nienna will
grant. There are five prayers all told, which are:
1. [[[[[BAlchemize] (Level 1)
   Allows you to improve items via alchemical essences.
2. [[[[[BRuneforge] (Level 1)
   Allows you to improve items via runes and runestones.
3. [[[[[BBomb Squad Duty] (Level 10)
   Temporarily boosts your ability to find and disarm traps.
4. [[[[[BBloody Tears] (Level 15)
   Causes you to harm yourself and bleed, scaring off monsters who have to watch your horrible act.
   At level 25 it can also confuse monsters.
5. [[[[[BWeeping] (Level 25)
   Restores some of your sanity.
   
Each of these spells can be increased in level both by improving your Prayer
skill, and by improving your Spell-power skill.

In addition to her specific magic, Nienna will also assist with your ability to
use some magic from the "standard" schools, in relation to how skilled you 
are at Prayer. These schools are as follows:
    *****m_divin.txt*0[Divination School] at 1/3 the Prayer skill level.
    *****m_celest.txt*0[Celestial School] at 1/2 the Prayer skill level.

The spells from these schools are all cast using your normal spellpoints.
