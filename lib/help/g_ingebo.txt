#####GIngeborg's Magic
Worshipping Ingeborg gives the adventurer access to a set of special
spells that come directly from the hands of Ingeborg. These spells use your piety
to cast rather than your spellpoints, and the level of spells that Ingeborg will 
permit you to use is determined by your Prayer skill - how skillful you are
in asking for her help without offending her!

There is a special book called the "Tome of Chaos" which 
contains instructions for the procedure for each of the prayers Ingeborg will
grant. There are NUMBER prayers all told, which are:
1. [[[[[Bspell name goes here] (Level 1)

2. [[[[[Bspell name goes here] (Level 1)
   text goes here.
3. [[[[[Bspell name goes here] (Level 1)
   text goes here.
4. [[[[[Bspell name goes here] (Level 1)
   text goes here.
5. [[[[[Bspell name goes here] (Level 1)
   text goes here.
   
Each of these spells can be increased in level both by improving your Prayer
skill, and by improving your Spell-power skill.

In addition to her specific magic, Ingeborg will also assist with your ability to
use some magic from the "standard" schools, in relation to how skilled you 
are at Prayer. These schools are as follows:
    *****m_nature.txt*0[Nature School] at 1/10 the Prayer skill level.
    *****m_convey.txt*0[Conveyance School] at 1/10 the Prayer skill level.
