#####R === ToME Magic - Mana School ===

The mana school of magic contains spells where the raw force of magic is used
to create the final spell effect. There are rumours of a "Tome of Magical 
Energy" which contains all the mana school spells within its bindings.

Worshipping the God Eru Iluvatar also gives the ability to cast spells from
the mana school at a level of 1/2 of your prayer level. E.g. if the skill 
"Spirituality: Prayer" is at level 10, you can cast up to level 5 mana school
spells.

#####sMana Spells
There are four spells available for the mana school. These spells are:
1. [[[[[sManathrust] (school level 1)
   Conjures up mana into a powerful bolt.
   The damage is irresistible and will increase with spell level.
2. [[[[[sRemove Curses] (school level 10)
   Removes curses of worn objects.
   At spell level 20, removes heavy curses.
3. [[[[[sElemental Shield] (school level 20)
   Provides resistance to the four basic elements.
4. [[[[[sDisruption Shield] (school level 45)
   Uses mana instead of hitpoints to take damage.
   At spell level 5 switches to Globe of Invulnerability.
   The spell breaks as soon as a melee, shooting, throwing or magical skill
   action is attempted, and lasts only a short time otherwise.


#####GUdun spells that can be cast with Mana skill

1. [[[[[DDrain] (dual school level 1)
   Drains the mana contained in wands, staves and rods to increase yours.
#####v   Your Mana and Udun skills must have reached a combined average level 
#####v   of 1 in order to cast this spell.
