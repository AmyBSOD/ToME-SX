#####R=== Trolls ===

#####GDescription
Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points than most other
character races, so they make great warriors, and marginal priests. They
are also very stupid and clumsy. They are bad at searching, disarming,
perception, and stealth. They are so ugly that an orc grimaces in their
presence. They also happen to be fun to play.... Trolls always have
their strength sustained. At higher levels, trolls learn to enter a
berserk fury, and regenerate from their wounds automatically.
