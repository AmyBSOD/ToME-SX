#####R === ToME Magic - Celestial School ===

The celestial school of magic contains spells which deal elemental damage to
your enemies. There are rumors of a "Celestial Tome of the Heavens" which
contains all the celestial school spells within its bindings.

Worshipping the Goddess Varda Elentari also gives the ability to cast spells
from the celestial school at a level of 1/2 of your prayer level. E.g. if
the skill "Spirituality: Prayer" is at level 12, you can cast up to level 6
celestial school spells.
