#####R === ToME Magic - Fire School ===

The fire school of magic contains spells where the element of fire is used
to create the final spell effect. There are rumours of a "Tome of the Eternal
Flame" which contains all the fire school spells within its bindings.

#####RFire Spells
There are five spells available for the fire school. These spells are:
1. [[[[[RGlobe of Light] (school level 1)
   Creates a globe of pure light.
   At spell level 3 it starts damaging monsters.
   At spell level 15 it starts creating a more powerful kind of light.
2. [[[[[RFire Golem] (dual school level 7)
   Creates a fiery golem and controls it.
   During the control the available keylist is:
      Movement keys: move the golem (depending on its speed it can move more
          than one square).
      , : pickup all items on the floor
      d : drop all carried items
      i : list all carried items
      m : end the possession/use golem powers
      Most of the other keys are disabled; you cannot interact with your
      real body while controlling the golem.
   But to cast the spell you will need a lantern or a wooden torch to create
   the golem.
