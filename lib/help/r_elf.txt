#####R=== Elves ===

#####GDescription
Elves are better magicians than humans, but not as good at fighting. They 
tend to be smarter and faster than either humans or half-elves and also 
have better wisdom. Elves are better at searching, disarming, perception, 
stealth, bows, and magic, but they are not as good at hand weapons.
They resist light effects intrinsically.
