~~~~~05|Options
#####R=== Options and Effects (ToME 2.1.x) ===

Most of the options are accessible through the '=' command, which provides
an interface to the various sets of options available to the player.

In the descriptions below, each option is listed as the textual summary
which is shown on the options screen, plus the internal name of the
option in brackets, followed by a textual description of the option.

Note that the internal name of the option can be used in user pref files
to force the option to a given setting; see *****command.txt*105["command.txt"] for more info.

Various concepts are mentioned in the descriptions below, including "disturb"
(cancel any running, resting, or repeated commands, which are in progress),
"flush" (forget any keypresses waiting in the keypress queue, including any
macros in progress), and "fresh" (dump any pending output to the screen).

~~~~~06|Options|Startup
#####R=== Birth/Startup Options ===

The birth or startup options are only able to be changed during character
creation, and can be accessed by typing '=' during the creation process. They
can also be viewed from the option menu while playing, but not changed then.

#####GMaximise stats    [maximize]
    Maximise causes the race and class stat bonuses to be applied like
    equipment bonuses.  This usually makes the character harder at the
    beginning of the game, but easier later on, since the stats are no longer
    limited to a "natural" value of 28 (18/100).

#####GPreserve artifacts    [preserve]
    Preserve artifacts cancels all level feelings of the "special" variety,
    but allows missed artifacts to be "saved" by wandering monsters and
    found again at a later time.  This only works for non-identified artifacts.

#####GSpecify 'minimal' stats    [autoroll]
    Uses the standard autoroller for character creation. This allows the player
    to specify a set of minimum values for the stats, and the game will keep
    rerolling until it achieves them (or 1 million rolls, whichever comes
    first).  Be warned, however, that there is a maximum total power permitted
    for a starting character. Setting one stat to near maximum is easily
    achievable; 2 is reasonable; but 3 would require the remaining 3 stats to
    be near their minimum values.

#####GGenerate character using a point system    [point_based]
    Allows the player to distribute a certain number of points among her stats.
    It results in the player being able to get one or two really high stats, at
    the expense of other not-so-important stats; or to have a well-rounded
    character who is above average (but not great) in all stats. Unused points
    convert into starting gold for the player.

#####GGenerate persistent dungeons    [permanent_levels]
    Setting this option means that level 1 of the dungeon will always have
    the same dungeon map each time you visit it (like the Nethack dungeon).

#####GAlways generate very unusual rooms    [ironman_rooms]
    Tries to place a special room or vault on every dungeon level. Very fun,
    but extremely deadly - imagine that Greater Checkerboard Vault with Lokkak
    on dungeon level 1!

#####GAllow notes to be written to a file    [take_notes]
    Allows any player-written notes (with the "|" command) to be written to
    a file and kept (instead of being put in the message list).

#####GAutomatically note important events    [auto_notes]
    Used in conjunction with the take_notes option, this option makes a note
    each time you gain a level, kill a unique, find an artifact, etc.

#####GFast autoroller (NOT on multiuser systems)    [fast_autoroller]
    The normal autoroller has a built-in delay that helps prevent it from
    overloading a system. This option reduces that delay, allowing characters
    to be rolled in a much shorter time, but should not be used on multiuser
    systems.

#####GAllow use of some 'joke' monsters    [joke_monsters]
    Allows monsters flagged as being some of DarkGod's jokes to be generated.

#####GAlways make small levels    [always_small_level]
    Overrides the in-game option of small_levels, generating smaller levels
    whenever possible.

#####GYou can receive fates, good or bad    [fate_option]
    Allows the player to turn off ToME's *****fatespoi.txt*0[fates] for that character.

~~~~~07|Options|Ingame
#####RIN GAME OPTIONS
#####R===============

These options are available from within the game, and can be toggled on and
off at will during the course of the game.

~~~~~08|Options|Interface
#####R=== Option Set 1 -- User Interface ===

#####GRogue-like commands    [rogue_like_commands]
    Selects the "roguelike" command set (see *****command.txt*0["command.txt"] for info).
~~~~~1
#####GActivate quick messages    [quick_messages]
    Allows the use of any keypress as a response to the "-more-" prompt
    (useful for monster farming).  Allows most keys to mean "no" to any
    "[y/n]" prompt.

#####GPrompt for various information    [other_query_flag]
    No longer used.

#####GPrompt before picking things up    [carry_query_flag]
    Forces the game to ask you for confirmation when you do something that
    would normally cause an item to be picked up.
~~~~~4
#####GUse old target by default    [use_old_target]
    Forces all commands which normally ask for a direction to use the
    current target if there is one.  If the current target is a monster, it
    becomes unset when that monster dies.  Use of this option can be dangerous
    if you target locations on the ground, unless you clear them when done.

#####GPick things up by default    [always_pickup]
    Tells the game that walking onto an item should attempt to pick it up.
    Otherwise, you must use the "g" command, or the "-" command while walking.
    Combined with "carry_query_flag" (Prompt before picking things up), allows
    you to selectively pick up all items which you step on.

#####GPrompt before picking up heavy objects   [prompt_pickup_heavy]
    Generates a prompt whenever the character tries to pick up an item that
    would slow him down.

#####GRepeat obvious commands    [always_repeat]
    Tells the game that when you attempt to open a door or chest, bash
    a door, tunnel through walls, or disarm traps or chests, that you
    wish to repeat the command 99 times (see *****command.txt*0["command.txt"]).

#####GShow dungeon level in feet    [depth_in_feet]
    Display the dungeon depth in "feet" instead of as a level number (one
    level is equivalent to 50'). This also affects the monster memory display.

#####GMerge inscriptions when stacking    [stack_force_notes]
    Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if one has an empty
    inscription and the other does not.  The resulting stack keeps the
    non-empty inscription.

#####GMerge discounts when stacking    [stack_force_costs]
    Force otherwise identical objects to merge, even if they have different
    discounts.  The resulting stack keeps the largest discount.  This option
    may cause you to lose "value", but will give you optimal pack usage.

#####GShow labels in object lists    [show_labels]
    Display the "labels" for objects in the equipment list, and in any
    special window which is displaying the equipment.  These labels
    indicate what the player is using the object for, such as "wielding"
    or "wearing" (in a given location).  After you have played for a while,
    this information is no longer useful, and can be annoying.
    Note that in ToME this option no longer controls the "plain
    flavoured object descriptions": a separate option for them has been added
    under "ToME Options".

#####GShow weights in object lists    [show_weights]
    Display the weight of objects in the inventory and equipment lists,
    and in stores, and in any special window which is displaying any of
    these lists.

#####GShow graphics in inventory list   [show_inven_graph]
    Display the graphics of objects in the inventory list, and in any special
    window which is displaying the inventory list.

#####GShow graphics in equipment list   [show_equip_graph]
    Display the graphics of objects in the equipment list, and in any special
    window which is displaying the equipment list.

#####GShow graphics in stores   [show_store_graph]
    Display the graphics of objects in the store list.

#####GShow choices in certain sub-windows    [show_choices]
    Indicate legal choices in special windows which display lists.

#####GShow details in certain sub-windows    [show_details]
    Indicate extra details in special windows, currently used to activate
    the display of death counts and monster descriptions when recalling
    details about a monster.

#####GAudible bell (on errors, etc)    [ring_bell]
    Attempt to make a "bell" noise when various errors occur.

#####GUse color if possible (slow)    [use_color]
    This option enables the software support for colour.  Since this makes
    the game slower, you should always disable this option if you are using
    a machine which is not capable of using colours.

~~~~~09|Options|Disturbance
#####R=== Option Set 2 -- Disturbance ===

#####GRun past stairs    [find_ignore_stairs]
    Ignore stairs when running.

#####GRun through open doors    [find_ignore_doors]
    Ignore open doors when running.

#####GRun past known corners    [find_cut]
    Cut sharply around known corners when running.  This will result in
    faster running, but may cause you to run into a lurking monster.

#####GRun into potential corners    [find_examine]
    Fully explore potential corners in hallways.  This is strongly
    recommended if your light source has a small radius (e.g. a torch).

#####GDisturb whenever any monster moves    [disturb_move]
    Disturb the player when any monster moves, appears, or disappears.
    This includes monsters which are only visible due to telepathy, so
    you should probably turn this option off if you want to "rest" near
    such monsters.

#####GDisturb whenever viewable monster moves    [disturb_near]
    Disturb the player when any viewable monster moves, whenever any
    monster becomes viewable for the first time, and also whenever any
    viewable monster becomes no longer viewable.  This option ignores
    the existence of telepathy for the purpose of determining whether
    a monster is viewable.  See also the "view_reduce_view" option.

#####GDisturb whenever map panel changes    [disturb_panel]
    This option causes you to be disturbed (stop running) when the screen
    scrolls, as it does when you get close to the edge of the visible screen.

#####GDisturb whenever leaving trap-detected area    [disturb_detect]
    This option causes you to be disturbed whenever you are leaving
    a trap-detected area.  This option is strongly recommended.

#####GDisturb whenever player state changes    [disturb_state]
    This option causes you to be disturbed whenever the player state
    changes, including changes in hunger, resistance, confusion, etc.

#####GDisturb whenever boring things happen    [disturb_minor]
    This option causes you to be disturbed by various boring things,
    including monsters bashing down doors, inventory feelings, and
    beginning to run out of light-source fuel.

#####GDisturb whenever random things happen    [disturb_other]
    In ToME, uncursed teleporting items may teleport you around sometimes,
    asking for your confirmation (and possibly disturbing your rest). If you
    unset this option, they will stop asking you and teleporting you randomly.
    Cursed items will neither ask for confirmation nor stop teleporting you
    even if this option is unset.  (You may also inscribe an item with {.}
    to suppress its random-teleportation power, unless it is cursed.)

#####GAlert user to critical hitpoints    [alert_hitpoint]
    Produce a "bell" noise, and flushes all pending input, when your hitpoints
    reach the warning point chosen elsewhere, preventing stupid deaths.

#####GAlert user to various failures    [alert_failure]
    Produce a "bell" noise, and flushes all pending input, when various
    failures occur, as described above.

#####GGet last words when the character dies    [last_words]
    Display a random line  from  the "death.txt" file when your character
    dies. If this option is not selected, the "You die." message is displayed
    instead.

#####GAllow shopkeepers and uniques to speak    [speak_unique]
    If this option is in use, shopkeepers may sometimes whisper rumours to
    you. Also certain monsters start boasting as they attack you, and when
    they die, they say their "last words".

#####GNo query to destroy known worthless items    [auto_destroy]
    It can sometimes be annoying that the Destroy command asks for confirmation
    when you are attempting to destroy a Broken sword {cursed}. If this option
    is set, no confirmation will be asked if you attempt to destroy an object
    which you know to be worthless. Of course, cursed artifacts cannot be
    destroyed even if this option is set.

#####GConfirm to wear/wield known cursed items    [confirm_wear]
    Some players may occasionally, due to a typing mistake, find themselves
    wearing an item which they knew was cursed. If this option is set, you
    should be safe from such typing mistakes: you will be prompted if you
    attempt to wear or wield an item if your character knows it is cursed.

#####GPrompt before exiting a dungeon level    [confirm_stairs]
    Some players (such as myself) often accidentally press the '<' key
    and exit a Special feeling level. If this option is set, the program
    asks for confirmation before you go up or down the stairs. Others may
    find the prompt annoying; they should of course not set this option. :-)

#####GDisturb when visible pets move    [disturb_pets]
    The player may wish that some of the disturbance options do not apply
    to pets: for example, it can be annoying if your rest is always disturbed
    by a pet dog who pops in every now and then. By default, pets do not
    disturb you even if full monster disturbance options are set. If you
    want your pets to disturb you like normal monsters, set this option.

#####GAutomatically open doors    [easy_open]
    Opens (and unlocks) doors by walking into them.  Also, if you are adjacent
    to only one known door, using the "o"pen command will not prompt you for
    a direction.

#####GAutomatically disarm traps    [easy_disarm]
    Attempts to disarm traps by walking into/over them.  Also, if you are
    adjacent to only one known trap, using the "D"isarm command will not
    prompt you for a direction.  If your disarming ability is particularly
    low, you should probably not enable this option, because you will often
    fail to disarm the traps, and sometimes trigger them.

#####GAutomatically tunnel walls    [easy_tunnel]
    Automatically tunnels into walls by walking into them.

~~~~~10|Options|Game-play
#####R=== Option Set 3 -- Game-play ===

#####GAuto-haggle in stores    [auto_haggle]
    Disable haggling in stores, resulting in a ten percent sales tax
    on items which you would have otherwise been forced to haggle for.
    When this option is on, all prices listed in stores will be the
    actual price that you pay for an item, as opposed to the price
    that the shop-keeper will suggest.

#####GAuto-scum for good levels    [auto_scum]
    This is a hack but allows you to force the generation of "good" levels
    in the dungeon.  This option may be extremely slow on some machines,
    especially deep in the dungeon.  The minimum "goodness" of the level
    is based on the dungeon level, so the deeper you go, the better the
    level will be.

#####GAllow weapons and armor to stack    [stack_allow_items]
    Allow identical weapons and armor to be combined into a stack.  This
    also allows unidentified, but identical, ammo to be combined, which
    may result in the auto-identification of some of the ammo, but which
    makes it a lot easier to actually use unidentified ammo.

#####GAllow wands/staffs/rods to stack    [stack_allow_wands]
    Allow identical wands/staffs/rods to be combined into a stack.  This
    may force the items to be unstacked to use them, which may result
    in overflow of the pack.  Also, the entire stack can be recharged
    (and possibly destroyed) at the same time.

#####GExpand the power of the look command    [expand_look]
    Expand the "l"ook command to allow the user to look at grids which
    are not actually in view of the player, allowing the examination of
    objects/monsters which have only been detected by spells, or sensed
    via telepathy.

#####GExpand the power of the list commands    [expand_list]
    Expand the "listing" commands so that they wrap at the edges of
    the appropriate list.  This allows the "l"ook and "t"arget commands
    to cycle through all appropriate grids forever, and the "identify
    symbol" to browse through all of the monsters of a given type.

#####GMap remembers all perma-lit grids    [view_perma_grids]
    Memorise all perma-lit floor grids which are seen by the player.
    This option allows you to keep track of which explored floor grids
    were perma-lit, but does not distinguish between dark floor grids,
    unexplored floor grids, and unknown grids.  Turning off this option
    allows the player to always know which lit floor grids are in line
    of sight, but this is better accomplished by the "view_bright_lite"
    option.  Note that any non-floor grids which is seen by the player
    are always memorised, and any object which is seen by the player is
    memorised independently from the memorisation of the grid itself.

#####GMap remembers all torch-lit grids    [view_torch_grids]
    Memorise all (torch-lit) floor grids which are seen by the player.
    This option not only allows you to keep track of which floor grids
    have been explored, but also which ones are dark, because the use
    of this option activates a special color scheme for the display of
    floor grids, in which dark grids are drawn in dark grey, lit grids
    are drawn in white, and (if the "view_bright_lite" option is set)
    lit grids which are also in line of sight are drawn in orange.  Note
    that grids which are currently torch-lit are considered to be "lit",
    and are thus drawn in white, unless the "view_yellow_lite" option is
    set, in which case they are drawn in yellow.

#####GAllow some monsters to carry light    [monster_lite]
    This option allows some monsters to carry light sources around with them,
    lighting up the space around them. It can also allow you to see when some
    monsters are heading your way before they reach the bend in the corridor
    where you are hiding in ambush....

#####GGenerate dungeons with aligned rooms    [dungeon_align]
    Force all rooms to be aligned with the "panel" divisions.  This results
    in a much prettier dungeon, but may result in fewer greater vaults.

#####GGenerate dungeons with connected stairs    [dungeon_stair]
    Always generate a staircase back to the level whence you came, if you used
    a staircase to get to the level.  This is more "realistic", and safer,
    but less of a challenge for some people.

#####GMonsters chase current location (v.slow)    [flow_by_sound]
    Allow monsters to make paths to the player when they are nearby.  This
    option is extremely slow, but can produce viciously smart monsters.

#####GMonsters chase recent locations (v.slow)    [flow_by_smell]
    As above, but also allow monsters to take advantage of "old" trails
    that you may have left in the dungeon.
~~~~~3
#####GUse special symbols for the player char   [player_symbols]
    If this option has been compiled in, it allows you to display your
    character using race / class / sex dependent colours and graphical
    symbols. Note that the support for this option may not have been
    compiled in on all platforms.

#####GPlain object descriptions    [plain_descriptions]
    In ToME, this option disables "full" names for identified flavoured
    objects; in other words, if this option is not in use, an identified
    Potion of Speed could be listed (for example) as a Blue Potion of Speed.
    If you prefer simpler, less verbose descriptions, set this option.

#####GMonsters learn from their mistakes    [smart_learn]
    Allow monsters to learn what spell attacks you are resistant to,
    and to use this information to choose the best attacks.

#####GMonsters exploit players weaknesses    [smart_cheat]
    Allow monsters to know what spell attacks you are resistant to, without
    first having to observe such an attack upon you, and to use this
    information to choose the best attacks.

#####GMonsters behave stupidly    [stupid_monsters]
    ToME incorporates Keldon Jones' improved monster Artificial
    Intelligence patch. While this patch most certainly makes monsters
    behave more realistically, they will also be more deadly with the
    improved AI. If you are a sissy, set this option to get the old,
    really stupid monster AI.
    Note that the new AI is a bit processing power expensive. If you have
    an old computer (386sx) and ToME is running too slowly, you could
    try turning stupid_monsters on. Or dumpster-dive for a Pentium so you can
    run ToME. :-)

#####GAllow unusually small dungeon levels    [small_levels]
    This option enables the creation of levels of varying sizes. Levels
    that are as small as one "screen" (80x24) are possible, and they can be
    quite dangerous, especially for a low level character, because they have
    as many monsters and traps as their full-sized counterparts.
    Note that this option has the side effect of enabling / disabling
    'destroyed' levels (they are enabled if small levels are).

#####GAllow empty 'arena' levels      [empty_levels]
    Normal dungeon levels consist mostly of rock. If this option is in
    use, levels which have empty floor instead of solid rock may also
    be created (somewhat reminiscent of Nethack's "big-room" levels).
    These levels can be extremely deadly, especially with breathing
    monsters (since there are few obstructions to shield you). Arena levels
    may have vaults, nests and pits in them like normal levels. Some
    arena levels are dark when they are created, but most are lit.

~~~~~11|Options|Efficiency
#####R=== Option Set 4 -- Efficiency ===

#####GReduce lite-radius when running    [view_reduce_lite]
    Reduce the radius of the player's light to that of a torch (radius 1)
    when the player is running, which makes running more efficient (CPU-wise),
    but is extremely annoying.  Certain older versions of Angband used
    this behavior always, so "purists" should turn it on.

#####GReduce view-radius in town    [view_reduce_view]
    No longer in use.

#####GAvoid checking for user abort    [avoid_abort]
    Avoid checking to see if the user has pressed a key during resting
    or running or repeated commands.  This not only makes the game much
    more efficient (on many systems), but also allows the use of certain
    obscure macro sequences, such as turning this option on, resting until
    done, turning this option off, and casting a spell.  Note that the use
    of this option may be dangerous on certain "graphic" machines.  Resting
    for long periods of time with this option set is dangerous since the
    resting may not stop until the user takes damage from starvation.

#####GAvoid processing special colors    [avoid_other]
    Avoid processing the "multi-hued" or "clear" attributes of monsters.
    This will cause all multi-hued monsters to appear violet and all
    clear monsters to appear white, and will cause trappers and lurkers to
    be visible on some machines, but it may greatly increase efficiency
    especially when telepathy is active.  Certain systems may choose to set
    this option if they are unable to support the special color processing,
    but if they handle graphics "correctly", by using attr/char pairs with
    the "high bits" set, then not only will the game correctly avoid using
    any "dangerous" color processing, but it will allow such processing to
    occur when it is not dangerous.  So if you are using graphics, and you
    use a normal attr/char for the floor grids, then you can use the
    "special lighting effects" for floors.

#####GFlush input on various failures    [flush_failure]
    This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever various
    "failures" occur, such as failure to cast a spell, failure to use a wand,
    etc.  This is very useful if you use macros which include "directional"
    components with commands that can fail, since it will prevent you from
    walking towards monsters when your spells fail.

#####GFlush input whenever disturbed    [flush_disturb]
    This option forces the game to flush all pending input whenever the
    character is "disturbed".  This is useful if you use macros which take
    time, since it will prevent you from continuing your macro while being
    attacked by a monster.

#####GFlush input before every command    [flush_command]
    This option forces the game to flush all pending input before every
    command.  This option is silly, unless you are very paranoid.

#####GFlush output before every command    [fresh_before]
    This option forces the game to flush all output before every command.
    This will give you maximal information, but may slow down the game
    somewhat.  Note that this option is only useful when using macros,
    resting, running, or repeating commands, since the output is always
    flushed when the game is waiting for a keypress from the user.

#####GFlush output after every command    [fresh_after]
    This option forces the game to flush all output after not only every
    player command, but also after every round of processing monsters and
    objects, which will give you maximal information, but may slow down
    the game a lot, especially on slower machines; and on faster machines
    you normally do not have a chance to see the results anyway.

#####GFlush output after every message    [fresh_message]
    This option forces the game to flush all output after every message
    displayed by the game.  This will give you maximal information, but
    may slow down the game somewhat.

#####GCompress messages in savefiles    [compress_savefile]
    Compress the savefile, by only saving the most recent messages that
    the player has received.  This can cut the size of the savefile by a
    drastic amount, but will result in the loss of message information.
~~~~~2
#####GHilite the player with the cursor    [hilite_player]
    Place the visible cursor on the player.  This looks fine on some Unix
    machines, but horrible on most graphics machines.  Note that only some
    machines are able to *not* show the cursor, but on those machines, hiding
    the cursor often speeds up the game and looks better.

#####GUse special colors for torch-lit grids    [view_yellow_lite]
    This option causes special colors to be used for "torch-lit" grids in
    certain situations (see "view_granite_lite" and "view_special_lite").
    Turning this option off will slightly improve game speed.

#####GUse special colors for 'viewable' grids    [view_bright_lite]
    This option causes special colors to be used for non "viewable" grids
    in certain situations (see "view_granite_lite" and "view_special_lite").
    When this option is set, floor grids which are normally drawn in white
    but which are not currently viewable by the player are instead drawn
    in dark grey.  This makes the viewable grids appear brighter than the
    others, allowing the player to easily determine which floor grids are
    in line of sight.  Turning this option off will probably increase the
    speed of the game.

#####GUse special colors for wall grids (slow)    [view_granite_lite]
    This option activates a special color scheme for all wall grids which
    are normally drawn in white (as walls and rubble normally are).  When
    the player is blind, we use dark grey, else if the grid is torch-lit,
    we use yellow (or white, depending on the "view_yellow_lite" option),
    else if the "view_bright_lite" option is set, and the grid is not in line
    of sight, or the grid is dark, or the grid is only "partially" lit, then
    we use grey, otherwise we use the normal white.  Turning this option
    off will probably increase the speed of the game.

#####GUse special colors for floor grids (slow)    [view_special_lite]
    This option activates a special color scheme for all floor grids which
    are normally drawn in white (as they normally are).  When the player is
    blind, we use dark grey, else if the grid is torch-lit, we use yellow
    (or white, depending on the "view_yellow_lite" option), else if the grid
    is dark, we use dark grey, else if the "view_bright_lite" option is
    set, and the grid is not in line of sight, we use grey, otherwise we
    use the normal white.  Turning this option off will probably increase
    the speed of the game.

#####GCentre the view on the player (very slow)    [center_player]
    Keeps the player's character in the centre of the screen, and moves the
    dungeon around the player. Can be useful to prevent off-screen breaths.

~~~~~12|Options|ToME Options
#####R=== ToME Options ===

Features which are unique to ToME are collected in this menu.

#####GIngame contextual help    [ingame_help]
    Setting this option allows the game to trigger a help message the first
    time you come across an item or some other trigger. This is very useful
    for new players.  More experienced players may wish to switch this option
    off.

#####GShow the experience needed for the next level    [exp_need]
    Setting this option alters the display of experience on the left of
    the main screen to the experience needed to reach the next character level,
    instead of the character's current total experience.

#####GUse the old(Z) coloring scheme(reload the game)    [old_colors]
    Setting this option toggles the ASCII game colour display from the
    standard Angband monster colours to the Zangband-based monster colours.
    Since this alters the display and monster memory display, you need to
    reload the game when you alter this setting before it will display the
    new colours.

#####GAutomatically clear '-more-' prompts    [auto_more]
    Setting this option automatically clears any messages from the top
    of the window. Be warned that this could be dangerous, as you don't
    actually get to see the messages unless you use ^P.

#####GPlayer char represent his/her health    [player_char_health]
    Setting this option only affects the game when playing without tiles.
    As the player becomes injured, his icon changes to a figure representing
    the percentage of health remaining; for example if he is down to 68% of
    his maximum hitpoints, his character will be a '6' instead of an '@'.
    The character used only starts changing once the player has lost at
    least 30% of his maximum hitpoints.

#####GStats are represented in a linear way    [linear_stats]
    Setting this option alters the display of character stats. The default
    is 3 to 40 (linear), but the older 3 to 18/220 (Moria/Angband style) is
    retained for players who prefer it.

#####GIn option windows, just omit the select char    [inventory_no_move]
    If this option is set, the equipment/inventory windows don't move items
    around when a prompt asks for an item.


#####R=== Stacking Options ===

In ToME items are allowed to stack on floors and monsters are allowed to
maintain inventories. These features are enabled by default, and aren't
accessible through the option menu, but can still be disabled through
user pref files (see *****command.txt*105["command.txt"]).

#####GAllow objects to stack on the floor   [testing_stack]
        Allows a cave grid to hold more than one object (or one kind of
        object).

#####GAllow monsters to carry objects    [testing_carry]
        If this option is set, monsters which "pick up" objects will drop
        the objects they were carrying when you kill them. Note that monsters
        which "crush" objects are not affected by this option.

~~~~~13|Options|Base Delay Factor
#####R=== Base Delay Factor ===

The "delay_factor" value, if non-zero, is used to slow down the game, which is
useful to allow you to observe the temporal effects of bolt, beam, and ball
attacks.  The actual delay is equal to "delay_factor" cubed, in milliseconds.
Frequently used factors are 2 or 3.

~~~~~14|Options|Hitpoint Warning
#####R=== Hitpoint Warning ===

The "hitpoint_warn" value, if non-zero, is the percentage of maximal hitpoints
at which the player is warned that he may die.  It is also used as the cut-off
for using red to display hitpoints, mana and sanity. It is entered as a value
between 0 and 9 (0% and 90%).

~~~~~15|Options|Autosave
#####R=== Autosave Options ===

Ideally, the game should be so stable that these options are not needed
at all. However, even if the game were 100% reliable (which, to be frank, it
probably is not), the user might forget to save, and his hardware could fail
him. For all of these reasons, you may want to use these options:

#####GAutosave when entering new levels    [autosave_l]
        If this option is set, the program will attempt to save your
        character every time before creating a new dungeon level. Useful
        if you experience any game or computer crashes (or your dog enjoys
        kicking your power cords out of the wall like mine does!).

#####GTimed autosave    [autosave_t]
        If this option is set, the program will attempt to save your
        character every n game turns, where n is the "frequency".  To set
	frequency, press n: it will increase the frequency to the next
	category, these being every 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000,
	10000 or 25000 turns. (After 25000, pressing n again will cycle back
	to 0.) Note that the frequency must be higher than 0 and the
	"Timed autosave" set to "yes" for timed autosaves to take place.

~~~~~16|Options|Automatizer
#####R=== The Automatizer ===

Allows you to set options for the game to automatically destroy or pick up
objects when you identify them, for example skeletons, essences, cursed
daggers, etc. Useful for reducing the clutter in the dungeon, and reducing the
amount of loot to have to sort through. This *****automat.txt*0[Tutorial] may help you.

~~~~~17|Options|Window Flags
#####R=== Window Flags ===

Selects what kind of information is displayed in which window, on platforms
which use multiple windows.

You can select a window to be able to toggle between 2 different
sets of information (e.g. Basic Character stats and monster recall)
by pressing the "y" key over the second display option.

~~~~~18|Options|Cheating
#####R=== Cheating Options ===

#####GPeek into object creation    [cheat_peek]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at object creation.

#####GPeek into monster creation    [cheat_hear]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at monster creation.

#####GPeek into dungeon creation    [cheat_room]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can peek at room creation.

#####GPeek into something else    [cheat_xtra]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can see debugging messages.

#####GKnow complete monster info    [cheat_know]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can know all about monsters.

#####GAllow player to avoid death    [cheat_live]
    Cheaters never win.  But they can cheat death.

~~~~~19|Options|Dump/Load Options
#####R=== Dump Options ===

Allows the player to save the options to a file (defaults to charname.prf)
so that they can be reloaded into other character files.


#####R=== Load Options ===

Allows you to load a preference file saved through the "Dump Options"
command in another character file, hence saving all the initial time of having
to reset all the options every time you wish to play.
