#####R === ToME Magic - Geomancy ===
Geomancy harnesses the power of nature to awesome effect. Therefore neither
books nor light are necessary, and as the geomancers's skill increases, so do
his powers over the elements of nature.

Because Geomancy relies so heavily on the environment, you will need 
sufficient knowledge of the elemental skills (Earth, Air, Fire and Water) in 
order to cast some of the spells, and the exact effects of a spell often 
depend upon your levels in the elemental skills and your current surroundings.

The powers are accessed using the 'm' key and then selecting 'Use Geomancy';
they are cast with spell points, like normal spells, which can be increased
as usual through the *****skills.txt*21[Magic] skill.
