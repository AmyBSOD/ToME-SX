#####R === ToME Magic - Mind School ===

The mind school of magic contains spells which alter the mind. There are
rumours of a "Tome of the Mind" which contains all the mind school spells
within its bindings.

Worshipping the God Eru Iluvatar or the God Melkor Bauglir also gives the
ability to cast spells from the mind school at a level of 1/3 of your prayer
level. E.g. if the skill "Spirituality: Prayer" is at level 12, you can cast
up to level 4 mind school spells.

#####sMind Spells
There are four spells available for the mind school. These spells are:
1. [[[[[sCharm] (school level 1)
   Tries to manipulate the mind of a monster to make it friendly.
   At spell level 15 it turns into a ball.
   At spell level 35 it affects all monsters in sight.
2. [[[[[sConfuse] (school level 5)
   Tries to manipulate the mind of a monster to confuse it.
   At spell level 15 it turns into a ball.
   At spell level 35 it affects all monsters in sight.
3. [[[[[sArmor of Fear] (school level 10)
   Creates a shield of pure fear around you. Any monster attempting to hit
   you must save or flee.
4. [[[[[sStun] (school level 15)
   Tries to manipulate the mind of a monster to stun it.

#####GFire spells that can be cast with Mind skill

1. [[[[[RFire Golem] (school level 7)
   Creates a fiery golem and controls it.
   During the control the available keylist is:
      Movement keys: move the golem (depending on its speed it can move more
          than one square).
      , : pickup all items on the floor
      d : drop all carried items
      i : list all carried items
      m : end the possession/use golem powers
      Most of the other keys are disabled; you cannot interact with your
      real body while controlling the golem.
   But to cast the spell you will need a lantern or a wooden torch to create
   the golem.
#####v   Your Fire and Mind skills must have reached a combined average level 
#####v   of 7 in order to cast this spell.
