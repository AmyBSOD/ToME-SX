#####R=== Petty Dwarves ===

#####GDescription
A hated and persecuted race of nocturnal dwarves, these cave-dwellers are not
bothered much by darkness. Their natural inclination to magically augmented
items has made them immune to effects which could drain away magical
enchantments, and, like ordinary dwarves, they can examine the dungeon to
discover traps and secret doors.  They are quite proficient as priests,
warriors or rogues.
