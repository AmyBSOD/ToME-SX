#####R=== Wood Elves ===

#####GDescription
The first love of Wood Elves is hunting. As such, their skill with the bow
is unparalleled. They train tirelessly with their bows, to the point of 
neglecting even melee skills. They resist light as with other elves, and 
do extra damage with a ranged weapon. They are almost custom made for the 
archer class, but also make interesting warriors. Even Wood Elf Mages
are feasible, using the bow to attack and saving their magic for defence.
