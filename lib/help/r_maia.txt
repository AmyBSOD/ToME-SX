#####R=== Maia ===

#####GDescription
An old race, dating from before the creation of Arda, the Maiar were created by
Eru to help the Valar in their task. However, they can not worship a God, nor
is experience easy to remember for them. Due to their perceived advantages, 
they are rather disliked by the denizens of the dungeon, and will find that most
creatures take an instant dislike for the Maia. However, when they do finally 
manage to remember their encounters, they will find that their abilities will 
increase as they gain in knowledge.
