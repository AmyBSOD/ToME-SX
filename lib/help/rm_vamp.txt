#####R=== Vampire ===

#####GDescription
One of the mightier undead creatures, the vampire is an awe-inspiring 
sight. Yet this mighty creature has a serious weakness: the bright rays of
sun are its bane, and it will need to flee the surface to the deep 
recesses of the earth until the sun finally sets. Darkness, on the other 
hand, only makes the vampire stronger. Being undead, the vampire has a firm 
hold on its life force, and resists nether attacks. The vampire also 
resists cold and poison based attacks. It is, however, susceptible to its 
perpetual hunger for fresh blood, which can only be satiated by sucking 
the blood from a nearby monster, which is the vampire's special power.

It should be noted that the vampires are so sensitive to daylight that even
certain artifact light items which are filled with daylight will hurt them
if they try to wield the items. Fortunately, the vampires do not really
need these items, since they radiate an aura of 'dark light' of their own.
Light resistance will, in any case, protect the vampire from the adverse
effects of sunlight.
