#####R === ToME Magic - Demonology ===

Available only to Demonologists, or those sufficiently corrupted with
demon-like powers, this school contains spells where demonic energies
are used to create mainly devastating effects.

#####oDemonic equipment
Unlike other magic schools, the spells of a Demonologist are not written
in spell books, but are contained within items of demonic origin known as
Demonblades, Demonshields, and Demonhorns (helms), which when wielded allow
the Demonologist to cast spells; each piece of equipment holds three spells.

#####oDemonblade spells
