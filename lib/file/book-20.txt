Introduction:

Middle-earth is vast and mysterious, full of dangers but also full of
rewards for the brave.

New adventurers should know that pressing < and > can switch
the wilderness view between a normal scale and a larger map. This map
makes travelling safer and faster, but you can't enter wilderness
dungeons from it.


~~~~~1
#####G(a) The Towns

You start in a small village named Bree in the western part of the Middle-earth.
Here you will also find the entrance to the Barrow-Downs, a fairly safe and
simple dungeon.

When the Barrow-Downs become too easy for you, and Bree too small,
you might consider going to Lothlorien, the land of Galadriel. [[[[[BNote that]
[[[[[Byou should take a lot of food with you, for it is a long journey.] You'll have
to head south-east following the Moria mountain's chain, then walk around
the forest of Fangorn to head north to finally find your destination. The Forest
of Mirkwood (another dungeon) can be found to the north east of Lothlorien.

If you survive this dangerous dungeon, you should head south, following
the Anduin river. There, near the dark land of Mordor, you will find the
great town of Gondor, Minas Anor. From there you can want to pay a "visit" to 
the land of Mordor, which is east of Minas Anor.

After Mordor you should finally travel to Gondolin, the hidden town of the
Noldor. First go back to Bree, and then from there walk northeast and you
will find it. From this city, you will be able to attack Angband, the
dungeon of Morgoth, which is north west west of Gondolin.

#####G(b) Other strange and frightening places

The Old Forest to the west is the last remains of the big forests of the first
age, but it has been corrupted. It is said it is guarded by a living tree.

You may also wish to investigate the Orc Caves north of Bree; they are
another place suitable for those finished with the Barrow-Downs. They also
are rumored to hold great
mysteries.

The Maze: To the south of Bree there is a magical Maze. Many adventurers
that ventured there never came back... It is rumored that a Minotaur is
lurking down there, guarding an ancient and powerful artifact.
Bring along digging equipment and some means to recall.

Durin's Bane, the Balrog of Moria, guards the Mines of Moria, to the south east
of Bree.

During the Second Age of the world there was a great island called
Numenor. The people who dwelt there were wise and powerful, but as time
passed their last kings fell under the power of Sauron. Under Sauron's
orders, they tried to attack Valinor, the blessed land, and for this
Numenor was destroyed, swallowed by the sea. The ruins are still
accessible, far out to sea to the west of Bree.

Many other strange places wait to be explored by the valiant adventurer,
but their locations are secret. You will have to find them yourself!

#####G(c) Equipment issues

Beware adventurer! If you plan to go down into the dungeons be prepared. Some
items you will need badly.

First think of some light, maybe a lantern is better than the torches.

Second things to mention are your combat equipment. Sometimes the weapon and
armor you got from your mentor are not enough for the nasties inside the
dungeons.

And third and most important, [[[[[Balways carry a shovel or other digger with you],
because there is much rubble in the dungeons, which you cannot clear with
your hands.

#####G(d) Macros

Spellcasters might find that pressing 4 keys (at least) to cast a spell is a
lot, they are right. That is why there are macros. You can access the macro
screen by pressing @. You can find help on the *****macrofaq.txt*0[macros] in the docs.

Now you either have the hard way or the easy way.

**The Hard Way**

What the fellow adventurer should know is how to create a basic spell macro.
Press @ to enter the macro screen.
Press 4 to create a new macro.
Press the key to bind the macro to, usually one uses the F* keys(you can combine
them with the ctrl, shift, ... keys too)
Enter the key sequence to be done for the macro.
Press 2 to save the macro.

Now a problem that might arise, imagine your macro looks like: mcaa*t
to cast manathrust spell('m' to use skill, 'c' for cast a spell skill,
'a' for first book, 'a' for first spell, *t to… target the first monster).
This macro will break if you gain a new skill so that "Cast a spell" is no more
the skill 'c', or if you get a new book. There is a way around that.
When the game asks for a skill or a spell it allows you to press @ to enter
the skill/spell name directly, so your macro would become:
m@Cast a spell\r@Manathrust\r*t
Now this will always work as long as one of your books have the spell in it.


**The Easy Way**

This time you will only use the macro recorder. To do that:
Press $ to start it
Now each key you press will be recorded, so press all keys you want.
It is recommended to start your macro by pressing Escape key a few time, so
if there are messages when you use the macro it will first erase them instead
of screwing your macro :)
it is also recommended to take advantage of the @ key when selecting skills or
objects whenever the possibility is offered to you. It will make sure you
always use the good object/skill even if it moves in your inventory.
Once all keys are pressed press $ again to stop it.
It you are satisfied with your macro now you get to press the key to bind it
to.

As in the Hard Way you must use the macro screen if you want to permanently
save your macros.
