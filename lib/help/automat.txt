#####GWhat is the Automatizer?
The automatizer is an advanced auto-pickup or auto-squelch (auto-destroyer). At
a basic level, it will allow you to automatically destroy things that you have
no use for once you walk over them, providing that you have identified one of
them with your current character.

#####GIs that it?
Well no. The automatizer is far more flexible than that. The old-fashioned auto
squelch allowed you to destroy things dependent on how they pseudo-id'd - you
could auto-destroy all {cursed} swords for instance.
This is fine to start with, but once you get deep in the dungeon, and have a lot
of money and a decent weapon, you'll be interested in destroying {average} and
{good} items too right? Well the automatizer allows you to define destruction of
things providing you are of a certain level.

#####GSounds quite cool, but wha...
STOP RIGHT THERE! I haven't finished yet! Let's look at some other examples.
Most of the time, scrolls of darkness are pretty useless. Unless you are a
vampire, or an alchemist, right? So you might think it was no good to add
auto-destroy of scrolls of darkness to the automatizer. But you'd be wrong, for
you can add rules that are dependent on certain conditions, like that you are
of a certain race, or class.

#####GHey this is sounding good. What if it destroys my artifacts?
It can't. Artifacts can never be destroyed, by the automatizer. However, watch
out for items that are VERY cool but not artifacts... you wouldn't want to go
destroying boots of speed would you? Fortunately there are provisions for this
too, you could set a rule that destroyed all excellent boots (providing you were
past character level 45 say), but not if they were boots of speed.

#####GWoah! This sounds amazing!
Yes it is, isn't it.

#####GSo how do I use it?
Well the very simplest way is as follows. When you hit 'k' (^D in the roguelike
keyset) to destroy an item, you'll see that one option is "$ new automatizer
rule(OFF)". If you want to destroy all future items like that that you find,
then hit the $ key. You'll see that (OFF) changes to (ON). Now pick the item you
want to destroy. Let's say it is a Potion of Salt Water. You would now, as
normal, see a message "You destroy a Potion of Salt Water". Following this you
get a prompt, "Destroy all of the same [T]ype, [F]amily, or [N]ame, also use
[S]tatus (no)?". Let's take the easy one first and hit 'n' to go with name.
You'll now see a message, "Rule added, please go to the automatizer screen
(press = then T) to save the modified ruleset". Let's do that then, shall we. If
this is the first time you have used the automatizer with this savefile, you'll
be asked to enable it as you hit T. Confirm that you would like to enable it,
otherwise it won't work.

#####GWhat's the point in having it disabled then?
Well let's say you spotted something that you weren't sure how it would be
affected by your rules, but didn't want to destroy it; you could just disable
the automatizer for a moment and check it over before deciding what to do with
it and switching the automatizer back on.

#####GHmmm, ok. So I've enabled the automatizer, now what?
Well, you'll see a screen like this:

(snipped for brevity).

The automatizer rules are written in XML, so if you're familiar with that format
you shouldn't find things too difficult. It's also similar in format to HTML, as
you may notice from the way that there are opening tags (<name>) and closing
tags (</name>), and that everything between those tags is affected by that
rule.

#####GXML? HTML? What is this? Isn't ToME enough acronyms to be going on with?
OK, so you don't know anything about mark-up languages, it's no problem. Let's
take a look at the automatizer screen bit by bit, starting with the instructions
bottom right.

up/down to scroll. Well as you move the up/down cursor keys or number keys, a
different rule name is highlighted in the left hand window, and that rule is
displayed in the right hand window.
tab to switch to the rule window. Does what it says on the tin: switches to the
rule window (the right hand pane) to allow editing of existing rules.
u/d to move rules. Pressing 'u' or 'd' will move the rule up or down the order
displayed in the left hand window. Purely for cosmetic reasons.
new rule. Adds the beginning of a new rule.
rename rule. This is handy, as every rule added from the destroy prompt (as
explained above) is automatically named 'destroy', which gets a bit confusing
when you have 50 or so rules... renaming your rules will make them much easier
to edit later.
save rules. Saves all existing rules to a filename you designate (default is
automat.atm). Don't forget to do this after adding new rules/before exiting the
game.
k to disable the automatizer. Disables the automatizer, preserving the rules you
have made.

#####GYeah yeah, so what about the rule window on the right hand side itself?
OK, here we go. This is the real juicy stuff.

Anything inside pointy brackets (greater than and less than signs) is called a
tag. You'll notice that each tag opens with a word, and then that same word
appears in another tag later on, preceded by a slash. These are referred to as
opening tags (like <name> ) and closing tags (like </name> ). Everything within
a set of closing and opening tags is affected by those tags. This will make more
sense as we continue. Tags and the things they enclose are like "mini-rules"
which will together make up one rule. I call these mini-rules, clauses.

the first line:
<rule name="destroy" type="destroy">
Each rule starts with the tag <rule>, and this contains the rule name, and the
rule type. The rule name is how it is identified in the left hand window, and
need not be unique. The rule type will be either "destroy" (destroys items when
conditions stated below are met) or "pickup" (picks up item when conditions are
met) or "nothing" (neither picks up, nor destroys item when conditions are met)

The second line:
    <name>Potion of Salt Water</name>
This tells us that for the rule to be carried out, the name of the item must be
"Potion of Salt Water"

The third line:
</rule>
This tells us the rule is ended.

In total then, the rule named "destroy" checks to see if the name of every item
is Potion of Salt water, and if it is, it destroys it.

Nice and simple huh?

#####GYes Yes, very simple. It doesn't look very advanced at the moment.
Well, we've barely scratched the surface.
Let's take a look at those other options we got at the destroy prompt. Let's say
I was at a stage in the game where I wanted to be able to switch on an auto-
destroy for all swords that pseudo-id'd as {average}. So let's say I have a
dagger in my backpack, and I want to create an auto-destroy rule for that and
all subsequent swords... This is what I'd do:
Hit 'k' to destroy items and hit '$' to turn on automatizer rules. Then I'd 
select the dagger and confirm the destruction. Hit 's' to switch the status
toggle. This toggle will include (when ON) how the dagger pseudo-ids, and
finally hit 'f' to add a rule saying destroy by family. What you'll see in the
automatizer screen now is this:

#####GOK, well I can see the pseudo-id status is there, what's that tval thing? And
#####Gwhere does it say swords?
Well actually the tval thing is where it says swords! This is what is added by
the 'destroy by family' option.

It's probably worth explaining a bit here about the internal structure of ToME
code. Don't worry it's not too scary. In ToME, all objects are divided into
types: swords, axes, hafted-weapons, scrolls, rings etc. Every type is further
divided into sub-types. Eg swords are divided into daggers, broad swords, two-
handed swords and so on. Scrolls are divided into their specific actions;
scrolls of light, scrolls of satisfy hunger etc. Each type has a number assigned
to it, that never changes, and so does each sub-type. In this way we can
identify an exact object using just two values: it's type, or tvalue (tval) and
it's sub-type, or svalue (sval). You see where we're going with this?
Now daggers have a tval of 23 and an sval of 4. So you can see that we've said
in the rule that all things with a tval of 23 and a status of average can be
destroyed.

#####GAh, right. I see. And what's with the <and> tags?
Well, everything in those tags must be true for the rule to carry out. If we had
the <tval>23</tval> and the <status>average</average> lines without the <and>
tags, it would not be clear whether we wanted just one of those clauses to be
true for the rule to be carried out, or both of them.

#####GErr...
In other words, without the <and> tags it might look like we wanted to destroy
a) EVERYTHING that pseudo id'd as average, and
b) EVERY sword, regardless of how it pseudo-id'd!

#####GRight. What if I did want a rule that was more general, and had either/or
options in it?
Then there are tags to do that - the <or> </or> tags. If ANY of the clauses
return as true within or tags, then the rule is carried out. Substitute <or>
tags for the <and> tags in our sword example above, and the rule will operate in
the rather unhelpful way I explained above (all {average} things destroyed, and
all swords destroyed, regardless of how they pseudo-id). So essentially, if your
rule has more than one clause, you will need to include either <and> tags or
<or> tags, or in some cases both.

#####GOK and so what does the [T]ype option do?
It merely adds the sval, thus narrowing down the parameters for the auto-
destroy. For instance if I'd chosen to destroy by type rather than family in the
last example, we'd have ended up with this:

You can see in this example that we have nested <and> tags. Evaluating the tags
from the ones nested deepest first we can see that if an object has a tval of 23
and an sval between the values of 4 and 4 (i.e. if it is 4) then the rule will
check against the next part, which is to see if the object identifies {average}.
If it does, then all the clauses have been met and rule is carried out. In
short, it destroys all average daggers, rather than all average swords. Strictly
speaking the nested <and> tags aren't needed, but they do no harm, and are added
automatically when destroying by [T]ype.

#####GThis is all well and good but the numbers are going to get rather confusing
#####Garen't they? Be much easier if I could just write 'swords' or 'daggers'.
Well, you can. Kind of. Instead of using the admittedly rather obtuse numbers,
you can use the name of that tvalue rather than the number it represents. So
instead of <tval>23</tval> you could write <tval>TV_SWORD</tval>.

#####GAh that would be better. But where can I find out what all the names, and
#####Gnumbers of tvalues are?
Well I've written a *****defines.txt*0[file] which lists tvalues and one which lists svalues for you
to check on, and you may want to check the objects entry in k_info.txt in your
lib/edit directory. If you look at the entry for dagger you'll see:

N:43:& Dagger~
G:|:W
I:23:4:0
W:0:0:12:10
A:0/1:5/1:10/1:20/1
P:0:1d4:0:0:0
<snip>
The only line we're interested in is the one that starts I (for Index). The
first number is the tval, and the second is the sval.
Of course you could always rename your rule to make things clearer.

#####GOK so you mentioned something about setting rules up that happen only if a
#####Gplayer is a certain level?
Yeah, good point. Well, let's develop our destroy average swords rule for the
moment. Let's say we always wanted to destroy average swords by the time we got
to character level 20. They don't earn enough gold to make it worth carrying
back to town, and we'll have a better weapon by then anyway. So here we are in
the automatizer screen, with the destroy sword rule displaying in the right hand
window.  If we hit tab, the right window becomes active and the rules at the
bottom change:

You can see the <rule> tags have changed to purple, indicating they are the
active ones, that all key presses will act upon. Let's just quickly scoot
through these new commands:
up/down/left/right to navigate rule: These will change which clause is active,
enabling you to delete that clause, or add further clauses inside that one if it
so allows it.
9/3/7/1 to scroll: scrolls the whole screen which can become useful if you have
a particularly long rule or one with lots of nested clauses.
tab for switch: will make the left-hand window active again.
add clause: adds a new clause within the active one, providing the active clause
is either a <and>, <or> or <not> tag.
delete clause/rule: deletes the active clause, and any clauses nested within
that one. Therefore if the <rule> tags are active, the whole rule will be
deleted. Beware!

So if we now hit our right arrow we see that the <and> tags are active. We can
now add a new clause here. Let's do so by pressing 'a'. You'll now see a list of
different types of clauses you can add, which you simply scroll through using up
and down keys, and select by hitting enter. A brief description of the selected
clause is shown in the right hand window. Scroll down to the 'level' rule type
and hit enter. You'll be asked to enter a player level. Let's go for 20. You'll
then be asked for a maximum level, put 50, as we want the rule to be true from
level 20 and upwards. You'll now see our rule displays as:

So there we go. A rule which will destroy all {average} swords once the player
is past character level 20.

#####GHmmm I've tried this, it doesn't destroy cursed swords though...
Nope. You haven't told it to. If you want a scaling rule, which always destroys
cursed swords and then destroys average swords at character level 20, then {good}
swords at character level 35, have a look at this, rather more complicated rule.

#####GWoah! What the heck is that?!
OK ok slow down a minute. Look at it carefully and a clause at a time. It's not
difficult. Let's take it from the top. It's a destroying rule called swords. It
opens with some <and> tags. The object must be a sword (tval 23). Now we have an
OR tag, so we know that there are going to be some options:
option 1: the player is between level 0 and level 50, and the sword pseudo id's
as either cursed or worthless.
option 2: the player is above character level 15, and the sword pseudo id's as
average.
option 3: the player is above character level 25, and the sword pseudo id's as
good.
If any of these options are true, the rule is carried out. This rule could
easily be copied for other weapons or pieces of armour, substituting only the
tval, and perhaps the name.

#####GHmmm ok. looks good. I might want to change those character level values
#####Gthough. they look a bit low...
Well yeah, that's up to your playing style I guess... If you want to edit
clauses directly rather than delete and re-add them, you might want to edit the
automat.atm file directly. Just open it in your text editor  (it's located in
your lib/user directory or in ~/.tome on multiuser systems) and you'll see the
format is identical to how it is displayed in the automatizer file. Just watch
your spellings, and keep a back-up of the original to replace if things go
wrong. Don't mess about in there if you feel unsure of what you're doing though.

#####GSo what about those examples you gave up above? Like destroying scrolls of
#####Gdarkness unless you are a vampire or an alchemist?
OK, let's add this rule from scratch rather than from the destroy item prompt.
In the automatizer screen, hit 'n' for new rule. It asks for a name and a type
of rule (destroy/pickup/nothing). I called my rule "? of darkness", and it's a
destroy rule. It is worthwhile thinking at this point how the rule is going to
be structured; for very complicated rules pen and paper may help. We're going to
need to define the object (either by name, or by tval and sval) then we're going
to say unless the player race modifier is vampire, or the player class is
alchemist. So we are obviously going to have more than one clause, and the
clauses are going to have to BOTH be true for the rule to take effect so the
first clause we add is an <and> one. So hit 'a' for add clause and enter to
select the <and> clause. Lets now hit our right arrow, so the <and> tags are
active, and add a new rule. We can now select the <name> tags. At this point
we're prompted for the name. Now it's not case-sensitive, but you do need to
spell it correctly!
With the <and> tags still highlighted we now want to add our "unless vampire or
alchemist" clause. Seeing as this is an "unless" type clause, we start with a
<not> tag. So again, 'a'dd a new clause, and select <not>.
Now make the <not> tag active by moving right and down with the cursor keys. We
want "EITHER vampire or alchemist" so we include <or> tags, again by moving
across to make the <not> tags active and 'a'dding a new <or> clause. Then select
the <or> tags and 'a'dd a new <subrace> clause. Enter 'vampire'.
So the last part is to add alchemist. Now this might at first glance seem to be
a simple case of 'a'dding a new clause of the <class> type, within the <or>
tags, and there is certainly nothing 'wrong' with doing this. At present there
is no way for non-alchemists to get the alchemy skill, but it is sometimes best
to 'future-proof' against such possibilities. That's what we're going to do
here.
So rather than add a <class> clause, we're going to add a <skill> clause.
With the <or> tags active, 'a'dd a new <skill> clause. You're first asked for a
minimum skill level. Well, we can't use any skill unless we have 1.00 whole
skill points in it or more, so we can put 1 in here. We're then asked for a
maximum skill level, so we'll put in 50 here. The skill name must be spelled
correctly (as it appears on the skill screen) so we put 'Alchemy' here. Your
complete rule now appears as follows:

You'll notice I've also renamed the rules to make things a bit more legible.

#####GOK I'm getting there now, what about the boots of speed thing you talked about?

The majority of this is fairly similar to the swords rule; it destroys {average}
boots at character level 20, {good} ones at character level 35 and cursed ones
always. The addition is at the bottom. It adds clauses which will destroy
excellent items providing that they have been identified and that the name does
not contain the word "speed". The <state>identified</state> bit is important
here, as it would destroy the boots on pseudo-id otherwise, before it even saw
the full name of the boots.
