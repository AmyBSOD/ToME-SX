#####GOrome's Magic
Worshipping Orome gives the adventurer access to a set of special
spells that come directly from the hands of Orome. These spells use your piety
to cast rather than your spellpoints, and the level of spells that Orome will 
permit you to use is determined by your Prayer skill - how skillful you are
in asking for his help without offending him!

There is a special book called the "Tome of the Woods" which 
contains instructions for the procedure for each of the prayers Orome will
grant. There are five prayers all told, which are:
1. [[[[[BWilderness Sense] (Level 1)
   Allows you to sense animal minds for a while.
2. [[[[[BBullseye] (Level 10)
   Temporarily boosts your ranged weapon to-hit and damage.
3. [[[[[BSniper] (Level 25)
   Temporarily enchants your ranged weapon with extra might.
4. [[[[[BGood Hunting] (Level 30)
   Summons a leveled hound to your aid.
5. [[[[[BRapidfire] (Level 40)
   Temporarily enchants your ranged weapon with extra shots.
   
Each of these spells can be increased in level both by improving your Prayer
skill, and by improving your Spell-power skill.

In addition to his specific magic, Orome will also assist with your ability to
use some magic from the "standard" schools, in relation to how skilled you 
are at Prayer. These schools are as follows:
    *****m_nature.txt*0[Nature School] at 1/2 the Prayer skill level.
    *****m_convey.txt*0[Conveyance School] at 1/3 the Prayer skill level.
    *****m_divin.txt*0[Divination School] at 1/3 the Prayer skill level.
    *****m_tempo.txt*0[Temporal School] at 1/3 the Prayer skill level.
    *****m_earth.txt*0[Earth School] at 1/4 the Prayer skill level.

The spells from these schools are all cast using your normal spellpoints.
