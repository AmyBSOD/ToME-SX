#####GEste's Magic
Worshipping Este gives the adventurer access to a set of special
spells that come directly from the hands of Este. These spells use your piety
to cast rather than your spellpoints, and the level of spells that Este will 
permit you to use is determined by your Prayer skill - how skillful you are
in asking for her help without offending her!

There is a special book called the "Tome of Gentleness" which 
contains instructions for the procedure for each of the prayers Este will
grant. There are three prayers all told, which are:
1. [[[[[BDancing Lessons] (Level 1)
   Temporarily improves your dodging chances.
2. [[[[[BReveal Trap] (Level 30)
   Detects traps, including nasty traps.
3. [[[[[BDestroy Trap] (Level 40)
   Destroys adjacent traps, including nasty traps.
   
Each of these spells can be increased in level both by improving your Prayer
skill, and by improving your Spell-power skill.

In addition to her specific magic, Este will also assist with your ability to
use some magic from the "standard" schools, in relation to how skilled you 
are at Prayer. These schools are as follows:
    *****m_nature.txt*0[Nature School] at 1/2 the Prayer skill level.
    *****m_celest.txt*0[Celestial School] at 1/3 the Prayer skill level.
    *****m_water.txt*0[Water School] at 1/3 the Prayer skill level.
    *****m_air.txt*0[Air School] at 1/4 the Prayer skill level.

The spells from these schools are all cast using your normal spellpoints.
