#####GDescription
When Melkor first dug up Utumno and Angband, rivers were polluted and gave
birth to dark clouds of stinging insects; animals changed into dark, horrible
horned things and the forests themselves screamed in horror at their corruption.

*****g_yavann.txt*0[Yavanna] heard this scream and gave to some of the children of Eru the strength
to defend Nature; at first Ents were chosen, but later on other races were
allowed to tread the path of the Druid.

The embodiment of life itself, a Druid is a true force of nature and nothing
can prevent him from completing his final quest: returning Angband to the
grassy sunlit plain it once was.
