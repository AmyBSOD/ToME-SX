is forced to 0. A value > 100 means the player is knocked out. A value
>50 is a heavy stun. A value > 0 is a stun. If the stun level has
increased, a message is printed. There is a small chance of stun level
in 1000, or a 1 in 16 chance of a vicious blow which decreases
intelligence and/or wisdom for a while.

>v is the stun level.

forced to 0. A value > 1000 is a mortal wound. A value > 200 is a deep
gash. A value > 100 is a severe cut. A value > 50 is a nasty cut. A
value > 25 is a bad cut. A value > 10 is a light cut. A value > 0 is a
graze. If the cut level has increased, a message is printed. There is
a small chance of stun level in 1000, or a 1 in 16 chance of scarring
which decreases charisma for a while.

#####RFunction: set_food

#####GFile: xtra2.c

#####GComment: 
/*
* Set "p_ptr->food", notice observable changes
*
* The "p_ptr->food" variable can get as large as 20000, allowing the
* addition of the most "filling" item, Elvish Waybread, which adds
* 7500 food units, without overflowing the 32767 maximum limit.
*
* Perhaps we should disturb the player with various messages,
* especially messages about hunger status changes.  XXX XXX XXX
*
* Digestion of food is handled in "dungeon.c", in which, normally,
* the player digests about 20 food units per 100 game turns, more
* when "fast", more when "regenerating", less with "slow digestion",
* but when the player is "gorged", he digests 100 food units per 10
* game turns, or a full 1000 food units per 100 game turns.
*
* Note that the player's speed is reduced by 10 units while gorged,
* so if the player eats a single food ration (5000 food units) when
* full (15000 food units), he will be gorged for (5000/100)*10 = 500
* game turns, or 500/(100/5) = 25 player turns (if nothing else is
* affecting the player speed).
*/
