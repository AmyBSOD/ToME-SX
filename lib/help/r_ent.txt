#####GDescription
The Ents are a powerful race dating back to the beginning of the world and
are the eldest of all animals or plants that inhabit Arda. Spirits of the land,
they were summoned to guard the forests of Middle-earth. Being much like
trees they are very slow but strong, and very susceptible to fire.
As the Shepherds of the Trees, they have the innate ability to cause trees to
rise about them for protection.
