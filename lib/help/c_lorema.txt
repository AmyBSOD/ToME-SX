#####R=== Loremasters ===

#####GDescription
Loremasters are students of the creatures of Arda.

To protect themselves during their observations, they usually learn how to
pass unobserved, but should their attempt fail they have decent saving throws
and almost always learn some kind of combat style, but the exact preference
varies from Loremaster to Loremaster.

As a result of their studies, they become familiar with a broad range of
skills, ranging from *****skills.txt*45[Possession] and *****m_symbio.txt*0[Symbiosis] to *****skills.txt*43[Summoning] and *****skills.txt*47[Mimicry].
