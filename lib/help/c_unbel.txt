#####R=== Unbelievers ===

#####GDescription
The full opposite of Sorcerors, Unbelievers so strongly despise magic 
that not only do they refuse to use magic spells, they refuse all 
training in the use of magic items, which leaves them almost totally 
incompetent when trying to use a magic item.

#####GAntimagic
Thought carries power. And since Unbelievers think that magic doesn't
exist, they can suppress its manifestation around them.
Their magic-inhibiting ability and the area of effect around them are
determined by the skill level in Antimagic. If they wield a Dark Sword,
the strength and radius of the magic disrupting field are increased further,
with best results if the blade is unenchanted.

High levels of proficiency in Antimagic allow them also to stabilise the 
space-time continuum, so preventing teleportation, to sense the magical 
emanations coming from traps and to destroy these around them. 
These abilities are accessed using the 'm' key.
