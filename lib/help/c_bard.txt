#####R=== Bards ===

#####GDescription
Bards are traditional musicians. Their magical attacks are sound-based, and 
last as long as the Bard has mana. If the Bard runs out of mana, he/she stops
singing. There is also a low-level "spell" that will cease the song.

While any class can use musical instruments, only Bards can tap the 
power of voice to aid themselves and hinder, dismay, and kill their 
foes. 

#####GMagic Usage

Songs are continuous, and the song consumes mana every turn in order to 
maintain itself. The song will continue, once played, until either the 'Stop 
Singing' song is sung, or the player's mana runs out.

Each song has a magic school level associated with, just as any other magic 
spell does. Each song also has a Roman numeral (e.g. I, II, III, IV, V) 
following its name. These numerals correspond to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The higher the 
numeral, the more music skill the Bard must have to play that song.

Each musical instrument has a value between 1 and 4 assigned to it, as well. 
The higher the number, the better the craftmanship. A Bard can only play 
higher level songs with a more powerful instrument. You would be able to cast 
"Stop Singing (I)" and "Song of the Sun (I)" with a a Harp (+1). A Harp (+2) 
would allow you to sing those songs, as well as "Flow of Life (II)".
