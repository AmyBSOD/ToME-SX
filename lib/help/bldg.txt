~~~~~01|Buildings
#####R=== Historical Town View ===
The town is composed of both stores and buildings. 

#####RStores
The stores are where you can pick up the supplies you need before entering the
depths of the dungeon. These include:

[[[[[GGeneral Store (1):] food, torches, shovels... the necessities.
[[[[[GArmoury (2):] to protect from the ravages of the dungeon.
[[[[[GWeaponsmith (3):] they carry anything sharp and to the point.
[[[[[GTemple (4):] prayerbooks and those items holy.
[[[[[GAlchemist (5):] for all sorts of bubbling potions and scrolls.
[[[[[GMagic Shop (6):] get your wands and spellbooks here.
[[[[[GBlack Market (7):] the prices are high, but the items unique.
[[[[[GYour Home (8):] to store your precious treasures.
[[[[[GBook Store (9):] for all sorts of basic spell book needs.

#####ROther Buildings
In addition to the basic stores, there are some special buildings that can be
found in some towns. These buildings (represented by +'s) include:

[[[[[GMayor's Office/Castle:] The administrative center of the town.
Adventurers looking for work besides exploring the dungeon should hunt in here.
[[[[[GPet Shop:] Great place to purchase eggs and get pets.
[[[[[GThe Soothsayer:] To discover what *****/afatespoi.txt*0[fates ("a")] lie in store for you.
[[[[[GThe Inn:] Wine, dine, rest and relax!
[[[[[GThe Nest:] Thunderlords are masters of teleportation, and will consent to bear 
you to your chosen dungeon destination for a fee.
[[[[[GBeastmaster Shanty:] For those who enjoy trophy hunting, and to research the
strange animals seen during their adventures. 
[[[[[GFighters Hall:] The place to reforge weapons and armour.
[[[[[GRangers Guild:] The place to reforge bows and arrows.
[[[[[GLibrary:] For information of all kinds.
[[[[[GGambling House:] Read the *****/bgambling.txt*0[rules ("b")] before paying. The games are not 
rigged, just naturally difficult.
[[[[[GTower of Magery/Wizards Spire:] The wizards will identify your items or recharge 
your magical items for a fee.
[[[[[GInner temple/Priests Circle:] A place of healing.
[[[[[GPaladin guild:] Some healing and enchantments available.
[[[[[GThe Mathom House:] Donate your unwanted items to this museum.
... and several more!

Some of the places have been known to give out quests to adventurers they 
deem capable enough.  While the mayor's office is the obvious place to start, 
the Sea Dome or Beastmaster Shanty may also want you to bring in various heads
for reasons of their own.  Go into every building you can find.  Quests may
pop up in unexpected places.

There are misty rumours that there may be stores outside of Bree. The faintest
speak of stores of powerful items deep in the dungeon.
Rumours can be helpful or just plain silly.
All buildings are made of stone and unlikely to move around.
