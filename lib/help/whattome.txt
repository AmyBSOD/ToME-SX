Tales of Middle Earth (ToME) is a fantasy adventure game, based on the works 
of Tolkien. Focusing on game-play rather than fancy graphics that get boring 
after a week, ToME will keep you playing for years. 

Explore dozens of different dungeons including hundreds of randomly generated 
levels filled with multitudes of different items and treasures. Fight off 
hundreds of monsters and uniques from the stories in a complex fighting system. 
Gain experience and learn skills; choose from the dozens of races and classes 
available to the player; cast spells from simple teleportation spells to
advanced spells that can wipe out a whole army at once. It's the only game where
you can burn spell books by trudging in lava (unless you have gained immunity
from some armour), dry up rivers to cast mighty spells, strike at orcs with
blades attuned to slay them specifically, summon armies from a simple totem,
and even enter a symbiotic relationship with a mold!

Explore dungeons, gain power, and save Middle-earth!

The player will begin his adventure on the town level where he may acquire 
supplies, weapons, armour, and magical devices by bartering with various shop 
owners. After preparing for his adventure, the player can descend into the 
dungeon near Bree where fantastic adventures await his coming! 

Make sure you read the parchment you are given when you start the game, and 
read the in-game documentation.
