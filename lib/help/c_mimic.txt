#####R=== Mimics ===

#####GDescription
Mimics possess the ability to transform into various creatures using 
special cloaks. While transformed, they lose their intrinsic abilities, 
and gain those of the creature they have transformed into.

At higher skill levels, Mimics gain additional Mimicry powers which help them 
to further blend in with their surroundings or modify themselves.
