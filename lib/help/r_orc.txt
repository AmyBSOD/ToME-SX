#####R=== Orcs ===

#####GDescription
Orcs make excellent warriors and decent priests, but are terrible at magic.
They are as bad as dwarves at stealth, and horrible at searching, disarming,
and perception. Orcs are quite ugly, and tend to pay more for goods in town.
Orcs do make good warriors and rogues, for the simple reason that Orcs tend
to have great constitutions and lots of hit points. Because of their
preference for living underground rather than on the surface, orcs resist
darkness attacks. Upon reaching experience level 3, an orc learns to dispel
any fear that may be upon him.
