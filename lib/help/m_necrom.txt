#####R === ToME Magic - Necromancy ===
The art of Necromancy is the foul practice of manipulating the life
force of creatures.

Necromancy powers are accessed using the 'm' key and then selecting
'Use Necromancy'; they are cast with Spell Points, like normal spells,
and do not need light to be performed.

1. [[[[[DHorrify] (Level 1) Cost:2
   Calls upon the dark forces and opens a channel into the mind of a
   monster, stunning and scaring it.
   At level 21 it affects all monsters in a beam.
   At level 36 it affects all monsters in a ball.
   At level 46 it affects all monsters in sight.
2. [[[[[DRaise Dead] (Level 5) Cost:6
   This power makes corpses in a small radius around the caster rise as
   undead ego monsters at the service of the caster. The loyalty of those
   monsters is not guaranteed, though. It also heals all monsters within the
   same radius.
3. [[[[[DNecromantic Teeth] (Level 12) Cost:20
   This conjures up a temporary vampiric weapon.
4. [[[[[DAbsorb Soul] (Level 20) Cost:10
   This heals you by a substantial amount every time you kill a monster within
   its duration. It is especially useful when your character is in 
   *****ability.txt*12[Undead Form].
5. [[[[[DVampirism] (Level 30) Cost:15
   Drains part of the life-force from a nearby monster and gives it to you.
6. [[[[[DDeath] (Level 35) Cost:100
   Yes, the name is not nice. Neither are the effects: the target dies
   immediately, but so does your character (note that death is not such a great
   annoyance for necromancers).
