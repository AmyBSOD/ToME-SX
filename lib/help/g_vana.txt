#####GVana's Magic
Worshipping Vana gives the adventurer access to a set of special
spells that come directly from the hands of Vana. These spells use your piety
to cast rather than your spellpoints, and the level of spells that Vana will 
permit you to use is determined by your Prayer skill - how skillful you are
in asking for her help without offending her!

There is a special book called the "Tome of Youth" which 
contains instructions for the procedure for each of the prayers Vana will
grant. There are four prayers all told, which are:
1. [[[[[BIcy Wind] (Level 1)
   Shoots a bolt of ice from your fingertips.
   Sometimes it can blast through its first target.
2. [[[[[BFreezing Cloud] (Level 10)
   Creates a cloud of ice.
   The cloud will persist for some turns, damaging all monsters passing by.
3. [[[[[BDivine Restoration] (Level 20)
   Restores drained stats.
   At level 10 it restores lost experience.
4. [[[[[BPurification] (Level 35)
   Cures the black breath.
   
Each of these spells can be increased in level both by improving your Prayer
skill, and by improving your Spell-power skill.

In addition to her specific magic, Vana will also assist with your ability to
use some magic from the "standard" schools, in relation to how skilled you 
are at Prayer. These schools are as follows:
    *****m_tempo.txt*0[Temporal School] at 1/2 the Prayer skill level.
    *****m_meta.txt*0[Meta School] at 1/3 the Prayer skill level.
    *****m_convey.txt*0[Conveyance School] at 1/3 the Prayer skill level.
    *****m_music.txt*0[Music] at 1/3 the Prayer skill level.

The spells from these schools are all cast using your normal spellpoints.
