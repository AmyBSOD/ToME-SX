#####R === ToME Magic - Earth School ===

The earth school of magic contains spells where the element of earth is used
to create the final spell effect. There are rumours of a "Tome of the
Impenetrable Earth" which contains all the earth school spells within its
bindings.

Worshipping the God Tulkas or the Goddess Yavanna Kementari also gives the
ability to cast spells from the earth school, at a level of 4/5 or 1/2,
respectively, of your prayer level. E.g. if the skill "Spirituality: Prayer"
is at level 10, a worshipper of Tulkas can cast up to level 8 earth school
spells, whereas a worshipper of Yavanna can cast up to level 5 earth school
spells.

#####uEarth Spells
There are five spells available for the earth school. These Spells are:
1. [[[[[uStone Skin] (school level 1)

   At spell level 12 it turns into a ball of radius 1.
