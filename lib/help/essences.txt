#####REssence Spoiler for ToME 2.2.0
#####R------------------------------

Essences are the tools of the trade for Alchemists, and unfortunately are
useless for any other class. Alchemists use essences to create magical
items for them to use.

They can be either found on the floor while exploring the dungeon, or
extracted from other magical items the alchemist finds during his
adventures.

To create an artifact, the alchemist will first have to have learnt the 
Artifact Creation ability. This ability costs 70 skill points (yes, 70, 
it's a very powerful ability!). And you need an alchemy skill of at least 
40, plus INT and WIS at 35 (thats 18/170 in non-linear form).
To create the artifact, the alchemist will have to sacrifice 10 hit points,
and an amount of magic essence similar to his skill in alchemy. The
alchemist then allows the artifact to gain experience, and when it has
enough, uses that experience to add abilities to the artifact. The
alchemist can allow the artifact to continue to gain experience, thus
keeping open the option to add more abilities later. This requires a
similar amount of magic essence, but does not require the sacrifice of
more hit points.

Note that the experience you gain is divided among the artifacts that you
have as well as going to yourself, so you will gain levels more slowly when
empowering artifacts. Also, the artifact only gets 60% of the experience.
So killing a creature worth 20xp would gain 10 for you, and 6 for the
artifact.

You can also modify existing artifacts when you attain skill level 50. Also
at skill level 50 you will gain the ability to make temporary artifacts,
which don't require the complex empowerments that regular items require,
but also vanish after awhile.

You cannot give an artifact an ability unless you have *Identified* an
artifact which has that ability.

For every four levels gained in the alchemy skill, the alchemist learns
about objects of level (skill level)/4, starting by learning about level 1
objects at skill level 0. (actually 1, but who's counting?)

At skill level 5 you gain the ability to make ego items - but watch it!
Your base failure rate will be 90%, and won't be 0% until you reach skill
level 50. Adding gold will increase the chances of success in direct
proportion to the value of the item you are trying to create. Note that
this results in automatic success when the item you are trying to create
happens to pick up a curse in the process.

At skill level 5 you also gain knowledge of some basic ego item recipes.
These are: Acidic, Shocking, Fiery, Frozen, Venomous, and Chaotic weapons,
Resist Fire armour, and light sources of Fearlessness.

At skill level 10 you will gain knowledge of digging ego items, if you have
selected the option "always generate very unusual rooms" (ironman_rooms).

At skill level 15 you can create ego wands, staves, rings, etc.

At skill level 25 you gain the ability to empower double ego items.

At skill level 50 you gain the ability to create temporary artifacts, which
don't require any exotic ingredients beyond a single corpse of any type.

Between skill levels 25 and 50, you will steadily gain the ability to set
more and more flags.

To finalise an artifact, you "P"ower it, and select the powers you want.
Powers are divided into the following six categories:

*****essences.txt*04[Misc. (Auras, Light, See Invisibility, etc.)]
*****essences.txt*05[Weapon Brands]
