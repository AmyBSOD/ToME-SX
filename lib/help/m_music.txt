Musical songs can have powerful effects for those who have the ability to
play instruments, chiefly *****c_bard.txt*0[Bards].

In order to continue playing a song, mana is consumed each turn, until 
either the 'Stop Singing' song is sung, or the player's mana runs out.

Each song, as well as having a school level like any other magic spell, also
has a roman numeral following its name. The higher this number, the greater the
craftmanship of the instrument required to play it.

Each musical instrument has a value assigned to it as well, between 1 and 4. The
higher the number, the better the craftmanship; hence it will be possible
for the bard to play higher level songs only with more powerful instruments.
E.g. a Harp(+1) will allow you to cast "Stop Singing(I)" and "Song of the
Sun(I)". A Harp(+2) would allow you to sing those songs, as well as "Flow of
Life(II)".

There are 3 different types of instruments: Harps, Drums and Horns. Each type 
of instrument contains a different family of musical songs:
