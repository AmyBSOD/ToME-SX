#####R=== ToME Skills System ===
One of the big differences between standard "Vanilla" Angband and ToME is the
implementation of a skill system where the player can choose what skills she
will improve as her character progresses. As such, many abilities such as
spell casting, fighting and trap disarming *do not* increase automatically -
the player must choose to use skill points to improve those abilities. This
gives the player the chance to tailor a character to suit their playing style
with a lot more flexibility than has existed with a fixed progression system
in the past. However, not all types of characters are able to gain skills to
the same degree; while a fighter can learn some magic, he's unlikely to become
as good at it as a mage can. So the number of skill points required to raise
a skill to the next level varies according to the starting "type" of character.

You can also spend skill points in "one-off purchase" *****ability.txt*0[Abilities].

#####GThe Skills Menu
Each time you gain a level of experience, you receive 6 skill points to spread
around as you wish. To use these skill points, you need to access the skills
menu ("G" for both keysets). This opens up a long list of abilities that can
be improved.  The menu may look something like this:

Now, looking at this screen, there are several things to be aware of. The
first line lets you know if you have any available skill points to spend, and
how many there are. Following that are 2 description lines for the currently
selected skill - in this case they are describing the "Combat" skill. When
looking at the list of skills, there are a few different colours used - the
light green coloured skill (which also has its starting character in square
brackets []) is the currently selected one - Combat in the example above.
Skills that you cannot learn are omitted from the list. Skills that you are
capable of learning, but as yet have not, are coloured in orange, while skills
of which you have some knowledge are shown in white.

At the end of each skill is a pair of numbers. The first represents your
current level of knowledge in the skill, and the second how much an advance
in this knowledge investing one skill point in this skill would produce. So,
in the above example, if the player invested one skill point in their Combat
skill, the skill would increase from 02.000 to 02.800.

In addition, investing in some skills may raise your knowledge in others.
This improvement is based on the modifier in the related class (the one which
gets the free points).  For example, a skill point put into Weaponmastery
raises Combat by 0.5 skill points. This is actually multiplied by the skill
modifier that your character has in the Combat skill.  For example, a
Swordmaster investing a skill point into Weaponmastery would have his Combat
skill raised by 0.5 * [0.900] while a Runecrafter would have his Combat
skill raised by 0.5 * [0.200].

As well as this, skills are grouped together in similar types. Looking under
the Combat skill, there are subtypes of Weaponmastery, Archery and Antimagic.
An increase of one of these subskills may also increase the main skill by a
small amount. You can tell which skills have subskills by the + (or -) in front
of their name. The + indicates that there are more skills within this category.
To open a skill category up, move the cursor up/down until the skill category
is green, then hit the "Enter" key. Likewise, the - indicates that the category
is already opened, and selecting this and hitting the "Enter" key will close it
up again. Skills which don't have usable subskills start with a ".".

To spend points on a skill (including skill categories), use the left/right
arrow (right arrow or "6" adds one skill point, left arrow or "4" removes
one). Spending points on a sub-skill will also marginally improve the parent
skill (or skill category). When you've finished spending skill points (and any
unspent points *will* be saved), hit the "Esc" key to finish. This will give
a confirmation prompt to check that you really do want to spend your points as
you've assigned them. Saying 'y' saves the changes and allows you to use or
apply your new skills :).

All skills have a maximum level of 50, and as long as you can learn a skill, 
and have enough skill points to pump into it, it is theoretically possible to 
get it to level 50 no matter what your race, class or how you learned it. 

Each skill affects your character differently. It may be worth getting one or 
more of your characters skills to 50, but it may not be worth investing [[[[[Bany]
skill points in some other skills. As general and personal advice, which may
not work for you, I'd say concentrate on a few skills, and leave the others
empty. Just because you [[[[[Bcan] learn a skill, it doesn't mean you have to.
It often pays to have a plan ("I'm going to make this assassin the
stealthiest, most able-dodging, backstabber around. I'm not going to bother
with trapping or thieving ability") which you can stick to for the whole game.

#####GThe Skills Themselves
So you want to know what each of the skills do so that you can decide how to
spend you're hard-earned points, huh? Well, each skill affects different
abilities, and not all of them are intuitive - but they don't take all that
long to learn :).

you from casting spells, or teleporting away when they've almost killed you!
It also inhibits your ability to do magic, affecting *all* the magic and

points to your Sneakiness skill.
~~~~~20|Skills|Dodging
[[[[[BDodging]

adds 0.1 bonus skill points to your Sneakiness skill.
~~~~~21|Skills|Magic
[[[[[BMagic]
The Magic skill affects your general use of magic items, the amount of mana

Earth, Meta, Conveyance, Divination, Temporal, Mind, Nature, Udun, Demonology,

~~~~~54|Skills|Magic-device
[[[[[BMagic-device]
This skill is a sub-skill of the Magic skill. It eases the use of magical
devices, such as wands, staves, and rods, and boosts the casting level of spells
stored in a wand or a staff. *****magic.txt*02[More on this]. It also helps pseudo-id of magic
objects. Spending 1 skill point on your Magic-device skill adds 0.07 bonus skill
points to your Magic skill.
~~~~~22|Skills|Spell-power
[[[[[BSpell-power]
This skill is a sub-skill of the Magic skill. It boosts the casting level of
most spells you are capable of casting. For example, if you have level one in
the mana school, you could cast "Manathrust". For every 2.5 skill levels of
Spell-power, Manathrust becomes more powerful, adding +1 casting level to the
spell. Note that this is not exactly the same as certain magic items which 
boost spell power. Spending 1 skill point on your Spell-power skill adds 0.2 
bonus skill points to your Magic skill.

[[[[[BThis skill only affects the 11 primary schools] (Mana, Earth, Air, Fire, 
Water, Meta, Mind, Temporal, Conveyance, Divination and Nature), as well as
Geomancy and the spells granted by the Gods.
~~~~~23|Skills|Sorcery
[[[[[BSorcery]
This skill is a sub-skill of the Magic skill. It allows you to access any
spell in the 11 schools up to the sorcery skill level. For example, if you
have a sorcery skill of 1, you could cast "Manathrust", which is a level 1
mana school spell; and "Phase Door", which is a level 1 conveyance school
spell. Spending 1 skill point on your Sorcery skill adds 0.2 bonus skill
points to your Magic skill.

[[[[[BThis skill only affects the 11 primary schools] (Mana, Earth, Air, Fire, 
Water, Meta, Mind, Temporal, Conveyance, Divination and Nature).

However, handling that much magic is hazardous to your health, and as such
reduces both your hit points and your fighting ability. Any ability in sorcery
affects your Weaponmastery, Archery, Barehand-combat and gives a negative
percentage modifier to your total hit points, equal to the level of your
sorcery skill (i.e. if sorcery is 12.500, hit points get modified by -12.5%).
~~~~~24|Skills|Mana
[[[[[BMana]
This skill is a sub-skill of the Magic skill. It gives access to spells
within the *****m_mana.txt*0[mana] school, and as it increases so does the casting level of
spells already attained in the school. For example, if you have level 1 in
the mana school, you could cast "Manathrust" at a casting level of 1. For
every skill level you add to Mana, Manathrust will become more powerful,
adding 1 casting level to the spell. Spending 1 skill point on your Mana
skill adds 0.1 bonus skill points to your Magic skill.
~~~~~60|Skills|Geomancy
[[[[[BGeomancy]
This skill is a subskill of the Magic skill. It gives access to spells 
within the *****m_geoman.txt*0[Geomancy] school, and as it increases so does the casting level of
spells already attained in the school. Most spells from this school rely 
on the Fire, Water, Air and Earth skills as well. Spending 1 skill point 
on your Geomancy skill adds 0.45 bonus skill points to your Fire, Water, 
Air and Earth skills.
~~~~~25|Skills|Fire
[[[[[BFire]
This skill is a sub-skill of the Magic skill. It gives access to spells
within the *****m_fire.txt*0[fire] school, and as it increases so does the casting level of
spells already attained in the school. Spending 1 skill point on your Fire
skill adds 0.1 bonus skill points to your Magic skill.
~~~~~26|Skills|Water
[[[[[BWater]
This skill is a sub-skill of the Magic skill. It gives access to spells
within the *****m_water.txt*0[water] school, and as it increases so does the casting level of
