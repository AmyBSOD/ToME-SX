#####GOrome's Magic
Worshipping Orome gives the adventurer access to a set of special
spells that come directly from the hands of Orome. These spells use your piety
to cast rather than your spellpoints, and the level of spells that Orome will 
permit you to use is determined by your Prayer skill - how skillful you are
in asking for his help without offending him!

There is a special book called the "Tome of the Woods" which 
contains instructions for the procedure for each of the prayers Orome will
grant. There are (number) prayers all told, which are:
1. [[[[[Bspell name] (Level 1)

Each of these spells can be increased in level both by improving your Prayer
skill, and by improving your Spell-power skill.

In addition to her specific magic, Orome will also assist with your ability to
use some magic from the "standard" schools, in relation to how skilled you 
are at Prayer. These schools are as follows:
    *****m_school.txt*0[Name School] at 1/X the Prayer skill level.
    
The spells from these schools are all cast using your normal spellpoints.
