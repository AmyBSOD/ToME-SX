#####R=== Dark Elves ===

#####GDescription
Another dark, cave-dwelling race, likewise unhampered by darkness attacks,
the Dark Elves have a long tradition and knowledge of magic. With their 
intelligence and wisdom they can become superb mages or priests, and they
have an inherent magic missile attack available to them at a low level. With
their keen sight, they also learn to see invisible things as their relatives 
the High-Elves do, but at a higher level.
