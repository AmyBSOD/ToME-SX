#####GMelkor Bauglir's Magic
Worshipping Melkor Bauglir gives the adventurer access to a set of special
spells that come directly from the hands of Melkor. These spells use your piety
to cast rather than your spellpoints, and the level of spells that Melkor will 
permit you to use is determined by your Prayer skill - how skillful you are
in asking for his help without offending him!

There is a special book called the "Corrupted Tome of Melkor" which 
contains instructions for the procedure for each of the prayers Melkor will
grant. There are three prayers all told, which are:
1. [[[[[BCurse] (Level 1)
   It curses a monster, reducing its melee power
   At level 5 it can be auto-casted (with no piety cost) while fighting
   if your piety is over 5000.
   At level 15 it also reduces armor
   At level 25 it also reduces speed
   At level 35 it also reduces max life (but it is never fatal)
2. [[[[[BCorpse Explosion] (Level 10)
   It makes corpses in an area around you explode for a percent of their hit
   points as damage
3. [[[[[BMind Steal] (Level 20)
   It allows your spirit to temporarily leave your own body, which will
   be vulnerable, to control one of your enemies body
   
Each of these spells can be increased in level both by improving your Prayer
skill, and by improving your Spell-power skill.

In addition to his specific magic, Melkor will also assist with your ability to
use some magic from the "standard" schools, in relation to how skilled you 
are at Prayer. This school is as follows:
    *****m_mind.txt*0[Mind School] at 1/3 the Prayer skill level.
    
Melkor also grants all of his followers access to the *****m_udun.txt*0[Udun] school of magic,
but only powerful mages are able to cast all of its spells.

The spells from these schools are all cast using your normal spellpoints.
