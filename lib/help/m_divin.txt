#####R === ToME Magic - Divination School ===

The divination school of magic contains spells where magic is used to 
psychically gain information about things. There are rumours of a "Tome of 
Knowledge" which contains all the divination school spells within its bindings.

Worshipping the God Eru Iluvatar also gives the ability to cast spells from
the divination school at a level of 2/3 of your prayer level. E.g. if the 
skill "Spirituality: Prayer" is at level 12, you can cast up to level 8 
divination school spells.
