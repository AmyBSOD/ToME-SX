screen because the elemental schools are sub-skills of it.

Even from the start of his career, an inexperienced Necromancer
can channel forces from the underworld to assault the mind of
living creatures, therefore terrifying them. With little effort he
can also learn the art of reanimating a dead corpse, turning it into
an undead slave. It is only at a later point in his career that this
foul mage learns to manipulate his life force as well, gaining the
ability to absorb hit points from both living and dead opponents.
The greatest Necromancers even gain the ability to survive their own
death: when they should be killed, they instead turn into a ghostly
being; they then receive a set number of Death Points, which are in
all respects similar to hit points except that they go automatically
down each turn. If the Necromancer manages to kill a certain number
of creatures before his Death Points reach 0 he is returned to life;
otherwise his will dissipates and he finally achieves true death.
